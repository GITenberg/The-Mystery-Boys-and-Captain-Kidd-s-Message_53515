<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">NICKY AND THE VOODOO WOMAN</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with that colored boy?&rdquo;
whispered Nicky Lane to his comrades, Tom
and Cliff, &ldquo;Look! He stares up at the sun and
then he watches us as if he expects something
to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff and Tom lifted their heads from the
shallow pit in which they were digging. A
glance toward the top rail of the fence around
the field showed them a black-faced boy of
about ten, perched there. As they stared at
him he looked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only curious to know what we are doing,&rdquo;
Tom declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these Jamaica colored folks are,&rdquo; Cliff
added. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t understand why we want
to find old relics.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why does he look up at the sun?&rdquo; Nicky
persisted. &ldquo;See! He&rsquo;s doing it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy gave a glance toward the sun, about
two hours high, and then resumed his intent
stare toward the trench. Nicky leaned on his
spade handle and glowered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he expects us to be sun-struck?&rdquo;
Cliff suggested. &ldquo;Only it isn&rsquo;t hot
enough yet, and we&rsquo;re not working hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Tom declared, &ldquo;but I wish I
did. He seems to be fidgeting and nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky.
Of the trio of chums he was the most excitable
and impulsive. As he dropped his spade and
strode toward the fence, its occupant tumbled
off; scrambling to his feet he ran out of sight
around the side of an old, ramshackle cabin in a
corner of the enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny one,&rdquo; Cliff observed when
Nicky returned.</p>
<p>They discussed the strange actions of the
colored boy for a moment but since there was
no explanation they went back to work.</p>
<p>Nicky Lane was on a holiday with his two
bosom companions. The Amadale Military
Academy, which they all attended, had been
closed because there was an epidemic of &ldquo;flu&rdquo;
in the suburb of a mid-Western city in which
the school was located.</p>

<p>Most of the students had gone to their homes.
Cliff Gray lived with his Aunt Lucy in the very
suburb most affected by the epidemic; Tom and
Nicky were boarding there also. Cliff&rsquo;s father,
whom the boys had helped to rescue from detention
among some Incas of Peru, in an old hidden
Inca city among the Andes, was, at this
time, exploring and studying in the island of
Jamaica, among the West Indies. He was a
great scholar and a student of old civilizations
and was writing some chapters of a book on
the Carib Indians, the original inhabitants of
the islands when Columbus discovered them.</p>
<p>Cliff&rsquo;s Aunt Lucy thought it would be wise
for Cliff to join his father, to be well away
from danger of infection; because the three
chums were inseparable, consent was easily secured
for Tom and Nicky to go with him. The
three friends had been residing on a plantation
in the heart of the island for nearly a week.
There, with Cliff&rsquo;s father and a young man,
Clarence Neale, who was securing Carib relics
for a great Museum of Indian History in New
York, they tried to help out by searching for
Carib pottery and ornaments. Jamaica had a
great lure for them, for Nicky, a &ldquo;pirate bug,&rdquo;
called Jamaica &ldquo;Pirates&rsquo; Paradise!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>This interest was not due to any desire on
Nicky&rsquo;s part to be a wild, fierce seadog, sailing
from some port with letters of marque, to
pillage unprotected ships. The days for such
things lay far in the past and although Nicky
was excitable and impulsive he was, at heart, a
very steady, sincere boy, a true American living
up to the ideals of all that American boyhood
means.</p>
<p>But in Nicky&rsquo;s family there was an old paper
which was a direct message to one of his ancestors
from no less a person than the alleged
pirate, Captain Kidd!</p>
<p>Naturally Nicky, scarcely more than fourteen,
was elated when he knew that he was permitted
to accompany Cliff Gray, with their comrade,
Tom, slightly older than either, to the
island which had once been governed by a reformed
pirate, in the heart of the West Indies
where once piracy had flourished.</p>
<p>They found very little more than legends and
old tales to whet their interest. Piracy had
given place to commerce on the seas, as sailing
ships had surrendered to steam. And so, instead
of digging for buried treasure, on the sixth
morning of their visit, they had found themselves
digging carefully in a corner of an uncultivated
field, to unearth broken bits of earthenware,
possibly some small ornaments, or other
relics of the Caribs who once roamed the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Digging early to avoid the mid-day heat during
which everybody was quiet and inactive,
they had discovered the unaccountable interest
of the colored boy and when he had scuttled
away they returned to their work wondering a
little about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we rescued your father from the Incas
and got some of their gold the whole business
started with a mystery, Cliff.&rdquo; Tom referred
to an adventure during the previous summer
in which they had explored a hidden city in
Peru and gone through many exciting escapades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be odd if that boy started up a
new mystery?&rdquo; Nicky suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re right
in the heart of mystery land. Voodoo&mdash;piracy
in the past&mdash;and&mdash;and everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let him see you!&rdquo; Cliff
nudged his comrades. &ldquo;By the right side of
that old cabin&mdash;there&rsquo;s our &lsquo;boy-friend!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the ebony face protruded
around the old shack that stood in the field, not
far from their trench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, fellows,&rdquo; whispered Nicky, &ldquo;there is
something queer about this. How can we get
hold of him and make him tell us what he expects
is going to happen. He&rsquo;s just looked up
at the sun again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;You pretend to chase him,&rdquo; Tom advised.
&ldquo;When he disappears and is out of sight I will
go the other way and head him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky promptly started toward the boy, who
ran away around the cabin. Tom lost no time
in taking a direction around the other side of
the shack. There was a shrill yell of fear and
the sound of a scuffle, and back came Nicky and
Tom, almost dragging a terrified colored boy.</p>
<p>Cliff joined them close to the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Nicky, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going to hurt
you. But you tell us what made you look at
the sun and then watch us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was silent. Suddenly he began to
wriggle and to struggle and all three took hold
of him. They did not intend to harm him but
his actions had their curiosity fully aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! White boys! Let that colored boy
alone, do you hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrill, cracked voice came from the cabin.
The three white chums hesitated, looking at one
another and then at the cabin.</p>
<p>In its doorway stood an old, bent woman,
who seemed to be all skin and bones. Her face
looked like crinkled, black parchment, dry and
wrinkled. Her hands were skinny and had long
nails and clawlike fingers. She leaned on a stick
and made them all think of pictures of witches
they had seen. Her eyes blazed at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>A little frightened by the old crone&rsquo;s evident
fury, they let go of the boy who scuttled past
the woman into the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hurt him,&rdquo; Nicky said defiantly.
&ldquo;He was&mdash;&rdquo; and he told her how the boy had
acted. &ldquo;We wanted to know why he did it,&rdquo;
he ended.</p>
<p>The woman scowled at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very quick,&rdquo; she said in her shrill,
cracked tones. &ldquo;You go away or sun make you
very sick in the head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried Nicky, &ldquo;will it? Who says so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo; Tom nudged him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember
what Cliff&rsquo;s father told us about Voodoo
on these islands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Nicky answered under his breath.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not afraid! Why does she want us
to go away? What is there in this field that
she doesn&rsquo;t want us to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Voodoo, I tell you!&rdquo; Tom urged. &ldquo;These
old Voodoo witches can enchant people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; demanded
Nicky. The old woman was fumbling and tugging
at an old bag, dirty and of some queer
animal or reptile skin, as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Tom hesitated, &ldquo;I know they say
it&rsquo;s only the effect on ignorant minds that makes
Voodoo hurt people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t hurt me!&rdquo; declared Nicky,
&ldquo;And, as I say&mdash;why would she want to &lsquo;voodoo&rsquo;
us&mdash;white fellows and strangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Nicky&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Cliff declared. &ldquo;She
must have some reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered Nicky, excitedly, &ldquo;one of
you run and bring Mr. Gray or the other man&mdash;Mr.
Neale. Let&rsquo;s get to the bottom of this.
I&rsquo;ll give you any odds you like that she is trying
to drive us away because something&rsquo;s
hidden in this field&mdash;maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure!&rdquo; gasped Cliff and ran like a deer
for the older members of their party. Treasure!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">ONE HALF OF A CIPHER</span></span></h2>
<p>That the old crone was very much &ldquo;worked
up&rdquo; was easily to be seen. Tom and
Nicky, watching uneasily, saw her fumble in
her old bag and draw out with her bony fingers
three queer objects.</p>
<p>These were small figures, made rudely of
clay or mud. Tom and Nicky started and stared
at them. They were made in the shape of small
human figures, with heads a little larger than
peas, and with dented places to mark out the
arms and legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think those things are?&rdquo; Tom
whispered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this. Remember what
Mr. Neale said about this woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nicky answered softly. &ldquo;He said
Ma&rsquo;am Sib is a Voodoo woman and that the
colored people are afraid of her. But I&rsquo;m not!
I want to see what she is going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was quickly seen. She laid the little
objects in a row on the doorsill; all of them
had their tiny heads pointed out from the shade
of the roof, so that the heads were in the sunshine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>She scowled at Nicky and Tom, then muttered
under her breath and glanced up toward
the sun, then back at the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s just imagination,&rdquo; Tom told his
chum, &ldquo;but I feel sort of queer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky made a practical suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s trying to scare us away by
making us believe that she has bewitched us or
something,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that the
sun will do to us. If you&rsquo;re uneasy, go and
stay in the cabin shade at the side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom looked sheepish and uncomfortable, but
after hesitating for a while his fears overcame
his good sense and he went out of sight.</p>
<p>Nicky did not follow; instead, he made an
unexpected move.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash he leaped forward, bent and
made a scooping movement of his fingers.
When he dodged back out of reach of the irate
old woman&rsquo;s cane, his hand was closed over the
mud images.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep these,&rdquo; he said, trembling a little
with natural uncertainty as to the outcome of
his bravado.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Cliff with Mr. Neale!&rdquo; called
Tom from beside the cabin, while the colored
boy poked his head out through the door and
made his eyes roll in his excitement.</p>
<p>Cliff and the young archaelogist were climbing
the fence. They hurried over and confronted
the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Ma&rsquo;am Sib?&rdquo; asked
Clarence Neale quietly. He showed no anger,
only curiosity. The old woman looked up at
the tall, clean-cut young fellow, not much more
than twenty-two or so, and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White boys not to dig! I order them to go
yesterday. They come back! I&mdash;&rdquo; she made a
gesture toward Nicky who unclosed his hand.
The moisture of his palm was already breaking
up the shape of the figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliff&rsquo;s father told us about the Egyptians
doing this like this,&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;They used
to make little images of wax, he said, and put
spells on them to injure the magicians&rsquo; enemies&mdash;then
when they stuck pins in the wax, or
burned it, the enemies were supposed to suffer
with pain. But I didn&rsquo;t know they did that
sort of thing in Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Mr. Neale admitted. &ldquo;But
why did you come back to dig when Ma&rsquo;am
Sib ordered you away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t her field,&rdquo; Cliff answered. &ldquo;I asked
father. And, besides, there is another trench
started. See! Over there.&rdquo; He pointed to
the digging that had been done at a point closer
to the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they really hurt you&mdash;these voodoo
people?&rdquo; Tom asked. &ldquo;I began to feel sort of
uneasy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Neale spoke quietly in reply. &ldquo;The boy
was told to do as he did so as to suggest an
idea to you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You see, all sorts
of magic depend on our being afraid. We are
afraid of things we do not understand. Because
we don&rsquo;t understand them we think &lsquo;maybe
they do have power to hurt us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same as if I came to Tom
some morning and looked at him as if something
was wrong, and then asked him what&rsquo;s
the matter,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d wonder and then
begin to think that something was wrong and
he would begin to feel sick, if he kept thinking
about it long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Mr. Neale replied. &ldquo;Voodoo depends
on ignorance and fear. Because people
are ignorant and afraid, their own minds work
against them. Tom let himself imagine there
was danger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; Tom said, shamefacedly, &ldquo;but
it got the best of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did she do it?&rdquo; demanded Nicky.
&ldquo;Not just because we didn&rsquo;t obey her and stop
digging&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I claim there must be something hidden
here that she knows about and she tried, the
way she is used to doing, to drive us away,&rdquo;
Cliff declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything buried here that I
have heard about,&rdquo; Clarence Neale responded.
He turned to the woman, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;m Sib, what induced
you to try to frighten these friends of
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can help you?&rdquo; inquired a voice
behind them. So absorbed had they all been
in the discussion that they had not noticed the
arrival of a slender colored fellow of nineteen.
He stood just back of them, smiling pleasantly.
He was as black as ebony, with perfect, white
teeth which showed in strong contrast when he
gave his good-natured smile. He spoke without
the Southern Negro&rsquo;s dialect, as is the custom
of all the Jamaica inhabitants whose speech is
often of the very best English, with only a
few colloquial bits of dialect.</p>
<p>Mr. Neale turned. He recognized the grandson
of old Ma&rsquo;am Sib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother has been voodooing my
young assistants, Sam,&rdquo; he said pleasantly.
&ldquo;They were digging and she must have thought
that voodoo was easier than the natural way&mdash;to
come and ask me to keep them away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The young Negro shrugged his shoulders.
He had been sent to a school in the United
States and he was better educated than was
his ancient grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm is done, anyhow, sar,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;I ask you to forgive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; answered the white man, &ldquo;but I am
curious to know just what is so important that
she should take that sort of measure to drive off
our digging comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thought that there was something
buried here,&rdquo; explained the colored fellow.
&ldquo;She knew that I have been doing some exploring
in my spare time. But I found what I was
looking for&mdash;and I was so disappointed that I
did not even bother to tell her, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar. There is an old legend in our
family and my grandmother had told me and
I was searching for a letter. When Captain
William Kidd traded between New York and
these islands, before he was really a pirate, he
was much friends with our Governor. In those
days the Governor was kind to pirates. He
let them come into harbor and he did not give
them to the law for punishing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Nicky and his friends became alert. Nicky
thought of the old paper so carefully preserved
by his family, although no one thought it would
ever amount to anything. Cliff and Tom were
intensely interested because this was becoming
a living story, linking the present with the old,
piratical days and their natural love of adventure
was whetted by the suave words of the
colored man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not know about Captain Kidd,&rdquo;
Sam continued. Nicky knew a great deal but
he remained silent, listening eagerly. &ldquo;He was
really not as bad as the story books have made
him. He was not one of the terrible pirates.
But he did wrong and finally he was made a
prisoner in America, and was kept in prison
until he could be sent to England to be tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He became very earnest and they all drew
closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he was in prison he sent a letter to
his friend, the Governor of Jamaica, who had
a house not far from this place. That was the
owner of this field and his family holds it yet.
We are descendants of old family servants of
that Governor. Well, sar, the letter came one
day and the Governor began to brag about finding
great treasure soon; one of my race who
was his body-servant thought the letter must
tell about the treasure and so he stole it. But
he became disgusted and buried the despatch
box. I do not know why. At least, I did not
know why until I dug it up last night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>They were all tense with suspense as he
reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded
paper. Holding his hands around it until he
made sure that it was the right one, his eyes
rolling with the colored race&rsquo;s love for being
the center of the interest, he slowly opened the
paper, holding it down low so that they could
all see the surface.</p>
<p>It was dirty and brown with age and the ink
on it was faint and faded to a faint brownish
tint.</p>
<p>They all craned their necks.</p>
<p>What they saw was disappointing, as Sam
had said. There were three small, irregular
shaped circles toward the top of the paper, in
such a relation to one another that if a line had
been drawn between each pair so as to connect
them, they would have been at the points of
a triangle.</p>
<p>At one side, and a little lower down, was
the regulation, old-fashioned representation of
a compass to show direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Further down, there was part of a word
which they made out to be &ldquo;per.&rdquo; Still further
down, was a mass of tiny dots and marks, too
faint to be given any meaning, they were not
in the form of letters, but were just like the
blotches that break out on the skin during
measles-here, there and everywhere. But at
the left side they went right to the edge of the
paper, and there was a very dim line starting
there and running a little way in among the
blotches.</p>
<p>Just beneath was a nautical bearing: &ldquo;25&mdash;30&mdash;13 N.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see,&rdquo; said Sam, his finger running
along the left hand edge, &ldquo;this paper is torn
off. It is only half of a cipher, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Neale, Cliff and Tom nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is of no good.&rdquo; said Sam, but he returned
it to his pocket. &ldquo;It may come that the
other half will be found. I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned and looked, with surprise,
toward Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be,&rdquo; muttered Sam, &ldquo;that Ma&rsquo;am
Sib&rsquo;s voodoo has worked, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky was turning somersaults and rolling
about like a boy who has gone mad!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">A &ldquo;MYSTERY BOYS&rdquo; MEETING</span></span></h2>
<p>Watching Nicky&rsquo;s contortions, Ma&rsquo;am Sib
began to see pictures in her mind of herself
in jail and she became more afraid than she
had made the boys.</p>
<p>She knew that the open practice of voodoo
was against all laws and she had not really
meant to do any more than frighten the boys
off. But Nicky&rsquo;s actions caused her to dread
the consequences to herself. But Tom and Cliff,
understanding their comrade, had different
thoughts. When Tom looked at Cliff he saw
the latter calmly but determinedly scratching
his left ear. Tom instantly folded his arms!</p>
<p>Tom hastened to Nicky and grabbed his chum
between two somersaults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliff&rsquo;s calling for a council,&rdquo; he whispered.
Nicky became at once a very sober and quietly
normal young fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The three chums were the sole members of
a secret order which they named from the fact
that each of them had a mystery in his life;
so their secret order was called &ldquo;The Mystery
Boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky, to begin with, had in his family the
supposed message from the former pirate,
William Kidd. Tom&rsquo;s mystery had to do with
the fact that his sister had never been located
after an attack on a Mexican mine by bandits;
after which no trace of the girl, living there
with her father, the mine superintendent, had
ever been found. Cliff had solved his mystery
the summer before; his father, studying Inca
civilization, had been held prisoner by Incas
of the old Peruvian race, in a city hidden
among the Andes; a letter had reached Cliff,
and he, with Tom and Nicky and a history instructor
from Amadale, and with &ldquo;Quipu Bill&rdquo;
whom they had met in Peru, had discovered
and rescued the old scholar and had secured
some Inca gold at the same time.</p>
<p>The purpose of the secret order was to be
able to exchange ideas in the presence of other
people who were not members of the clique,
without the outsiders knowing about it. The
Mystery Boys had made up their order for the
purpose of helping one another in every way,
but in secret. Their motto was &ldquo;Seeing All,
I see nothing; Knowing All, I know nothing;
Telling All, I tell nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>In order to have help in rescuing Cliff&rsquo;s
father, the order had added the young history
instructor, a Mr. Whitley, and &ldquo;Quipu Bill,&rdquo; but
after the thrilling adventures among the Incas,
wherein the secret signals of the order had
served the members in many &ldquo;tight&rdquo; places,
Bill went off to a ranch in the West, and the
instructor returned to his classes; both retained
membership, but not actively.</p>
<p>Cliff&rsquo;s signal to Tom had been a call for a
secret communication, and Tom, folding his
arms in sign of agreement, quickly urged Nicky
to silence. Cliff understood Nicky&rsquo;s wild
capering.</p>
<p>Nicky, very sober, came up with Tom to rejoin
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just cutting up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was
letting off steam because it struck me as funny
that Ma&rsquo;am Sib went to all that trouble to scare
us away from a map or a cipher that had already
been found and that wasn&rsquo;t any use anyhow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Neale accepted the explanation; it
seemed a natural action that Nicky had indulged
in, thus explained. Ma&rsquo;am Sib was
greatly upset and began to beg them not to pay
any attention to her &ldquo;spell.&rdquo; Its effects were
all removed, she declared. They agreed and as
it was clear that young Sam was eager to have
them cause no trouble for his grandmother,
the boys and their older friend forgave the old
voodoo woman and hurried away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Mr. Neale returned to his conference with
some colored men who were excavating near
the plantation house where the white people
had their headquarters. Tom, Cliff and Nicky
could hardly wait to get off by themselves. As
soon as they succeeded, Nicky turned to his
companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you signal to me to say nothing,&rdquo;
Nicky told Cliff. &ldquo;It was all I could do to hold
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Cliff replied. &ldquo;You &lsquo;go off the
handle&rsquo; easy, anyhow. I guessed what made
you get so excited, and I didn&rsquo;t want you to
talk until we had had a meeting of our Order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky&rsquo;s &lsquo;message&rsquo; from Captain Kidd has
something to do with it,&rdquo; Tom guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something?&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;Everything! Why,
that half of the cipher would fit in with a half
that my uncle has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Hooray! We&rsquo;re
off again for adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Cliff counseled. &ldquo;There are some
things to decide. First of all, half the cipher
is in New York&mdash;or with Nicky&rsquo;s uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; Nicky laughed. &ldquo;I
got him to let me take a tracing of it. I held
the paper against a lamp shade and traced over
it. Here&rsquo;s the &lsquo;other half of the cipher!&rsquo; See
what you make of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dragged a leather billfold from his coat
pocket and extracted a neatly folded paper.
The others stared at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the original torn down on the side
where this jagged line shows?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; responded Nicky, &ldquo;and you see it&rsquo;s
on the side opposite to where Sam&rsquo;s paper is
ripped away. I think they&rsquo;d just fit together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;But even if you
have this half, there are things to consider;
but let&rsquo;s see if we can remember the other piece
and sketch it on this envelope,&rdquo; he drew a letter
from his pocket. &ldquo;Here&mdash;here&rsquo;s a pencil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got to work. On the sketch Nicky had
already made there were several dots at one
side, toward the top. Below them was the
word &ldquo;Dip&rdquo; and under that were more of the
little straggley blotches with a faint line starting
at the left hand side and close to a small
cross marked &ldquo;Reck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That word ought to be &lsquo;wreck&rsquo; I think,&rdquo;
Nicky suggested. They nodded. &ldquo;And here,
you see, is a nautical direction&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s the same as on the other paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Cliff stated. &ldquo;The other was some
degrees North Latitude, but this is West Longitude.
Now&mdash;what was the set of figures on
the other map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;was it thirty degrees
and twelve minutes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re away off,&rdquo; Tom broke in. &ldquo;It was
twenty-five degrees and twelve minutes and
thirty seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cliff argued. &ldquo;It was&mdash;no, it couldn&rsquo;t
have been twelve degrees North&mdash;that would
be in South America, I think&mdash;anyway, if I recall
my map, it wouldn&rsquo;t be where the pirates
used to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could remember it,&rdquo; Nicky said.
&ldquo;Then we could go and get the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Cliff hesitated. &ldquo;Maybe not. It
would be like stealing to take any treasure by
using the part of the map we don&rsquo;t own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Sam doesn&rsquo;t own it by right!&rdquo; Nicky
urged. &ldquo;It was sent to the Governor of Jamaica
and stolen from him. Then Sam found
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be part of the Governor&rsquo;s
family still alive,&rdquo; Tom said, agreeing with
Cliff&rsquo;s attitude, &ldquo;and if Captain Kidd sent the
map in two parts so that both his friends would
be sure to share in his treasure, we have no
right to take the other fellow&rsquo;s share!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;Anyhow, Sam
has no right to it either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has part of the map!&rdquo; Tom reminded
Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ought we to do?&rdquo; Nicky questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a case for older heads to decide,&rdquo;
Tom suggested. &ldquo;Cliff&rsquo;s father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can ask him,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;How
about letting Mr. Neale know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; Cliff asserted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s honest
and he knows a whole lot about these islands.
And he could help us a lot. My father could
advise us but he wouldn&rsquo;t want to go on any
adventure; he had enough of that with the
Incas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is Nicky&rsquo;s uncle, who has the
real map,&rdquo; Tom reminded his chums. &ldquo;How
about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tell Cliff&rsquo;s father first,&rdquo; Nicky urged.
&ldquo;Then we can do as he says.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It was agreed that this was the best way
out. They found the old scholar sorting some
broken bits of pottery. These had been taken
out of old mounds of refuse, centuries old,
where the Carib Indians had thrown their cast
off and broken utensils. Mr. Gray, by reason
of his wide experience with such things, and
with the help of the young archaeologist, had
become proficient at the art of piecing the
broken bits into their original places so that
many valuable objects were rebuilt, or, at least,
reassembled.</p>
<p>After he had heard their story, Mr. Gray
deliberated for a while and then he gave them
his opinion.</p>
<p>The boys admitted its soundness and decided
to act upon it that very evening!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">CAPTAIN&rsquo;S KIDD&rsquo;S GHOST</span></span></h2>
<p>Seated around the supper table in the plantation
house, the chums could hardly contain
their impatience while the colored servant removed
the dishes. The abrupt twilight had
passed into deep, dark night. A kerosene lamp
on the table threw weird shadows on the wall
and left uncanny mysteries in the dusky corners.</p>
<p>The table, moved near the window to get
the cooler evening breeze during the meal, was
finally cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel funny?&rdquo; asked Tom, looking
around the room. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s on account of
that voodoo stuff this morning, but for some
reason I feel kinda nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just your mind&mdash;your imagination,&rdquo;
laughed Cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Mr. Gray quietly told Clarence Neale why
the boys had decided to act on his advice, to
initiate the young collector into their mystic
order. They had half of a cipher, he explained,
and there was reason to believe that Sam had
the other half. Then, in order to carry on a
search, if they agreed that it was advisable, the
young fellows would require a cool, older head
to guide them, and perhaps a stout arm to help
them. &ldquo;I can carry on your work here, Clarence,&rdquo;
Mr. Gray finished his explanation. &ldquo;If
you want to try your hand at a different sort
of digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a choice between potsherds&rdquo;&mdash;he referred
to the bits of pottery which were thus
named&mdash;&ldquo;or treasure, count me in for adventure
every time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using a watch charm of Cliff&rsquo;s which
his father had made from an ancient Egyptian
scarab, or sacred beetle, suitably mounted,
Nicky gave Clarence Neale the oath of allegiance,
which also served as their motto. Clarence
Neale with his face serious and with a
sincere manner, took the vow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what it means,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Seeing
All&mdash;that you show me&mdash;I see nothing that I let
others know I see; Knowing All&mdash;all of your
plans&mdash;I know nothing, if anybody asks me;
Telling All&mdash;that is, letting you know everything
I know&mdash;I tell nothing, of our plans or
mysteries, to any outsider.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly,&rdquo; Nicky exclaimed. &ldquo;I
knew you would be the right sort. Now, we
will postpone the initiations and secret signs
until tomorrow when we have more time. Now
we want to tell you about our map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew out his copy and the drawing of
Sam&rsquo;s half which Cliff had made from memory.
They all bent over them on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad that you have taken me
into your councils,&rdquo; Clarence Neale declared.
&ldquo;I know something about this section. It is
very easy to see that it is some part of the
Florida coral archipelago, what we used to call
Ten Thousand Islands, stretching up along the
Gulf coast from down toward Cape Sable. I
used to fish in those waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums were delighted. Here was a real
mate and a fine aide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how did this half come into your
family&rsquo;s possession?&rdquo; asked the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Nicky explained, &ldquo;you see, Captain
William Kidd was supposed to be a mighty
pirate and a fearful one. History and story
books don&rsquo;t agree, there. I&rsquo;ve studied a lot
about him because I am pretty much a &lsquo;bug&rsquo;
about him, on account of this map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Neale, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame
you. I know a bit of the old fellow&rsquo;s true
history too. He was in the regular trade for
quite a while, and ran from these Islands to
New York with his ship, and he was as honest
as any, I guess. That must be the time that
he made friends with the Jamaica governor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nicky took up the talk. &ldquo;He traded
with the West Indies during King William&rsquo;s
War, and it was after that time that the citizens
of Antigua gave him a bark of the same name.
And in 1690 he got a commission from the
English&mdash;what do you guess for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To despoil and break up pirate bands,&rdquo; exclaimed
Cliff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told us, Nicky&mdash;but go
ahead. Tell us again. It&rsquo;s interesting, and
especially right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you could imagine we were in the
cabin of a ship, right now,&rdquo; broke in Tom, &ldquo;all
except the windows. Look at the heavy timbers
of the room, and the oil lamp and&mdash;s-sh-h-h!
What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stared at him. Tom&rsquo;s eyes had
become round with fear. He was usually of
a very level headed type, and not likely to get
himself upset; but the voodoo had preyed upon
his imagination and this, with the excitement
of the treasure map&rsquo;s discovery, had made him
more sensitive to excitement than usual.</p>
<p>He stared through the open window. They
all turned their eyes that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tom?&rdquo; demanded Nicky in a
hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw a face&mdash;in the shadows&mdash;outside
the window,&rdquo; Tom said shakily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Nicky was up and out of the room like a
flash. Cliff, losing no time, raced in the other
direction. They went scuttling around the
house, from front and back, meeting under the
dining room window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody here&mdash;not a sign!&rdquo; called Cliff reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody in sight,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;Tom,
who was it&mdash;what did the face look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; quavered Tom. &ldquo;It looked
like&mdash;it was white&mdash;it was like a&mdash;ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull yourself together,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray
quietly. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any ghosts. Your
imagination is keyed up. Perhaps you saw
some bird fly past with the light on its wings
and your excitement made you see the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, boys,&rdquo; called Clarence Neale, &ldquo;I
am sure there was no occasion for fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two searchers returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Tom,&rdquo; said Cliff, not unkindly.
&ldquo;Nobody was running away and nobody was
in sight. You don&rsquo;t want us to think that you
really believe in ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, sheepishly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I said
it looked like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Neale, &ldquo;we have &lsquo;sort
of interrupted&rsquo; Captain Kidd, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was his ghost!&rdquo; grinned Nicky. &ldquo;I
hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Mr. Neale and Cliff&rsquo;s father gave warning
shakes of their heads and Nicky apologized for
joking at Tom&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor old fellow wasn&rsquo;t so bad&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no reason for his ghost to walk, even if there
was such a chance,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said. &ldquo;You
know he sailed off in the <i>Adventure Galley</i> to
execute his commission, but pirates were few
and far between, and he sailed around the Cape
of Good Hope. You know, that real and terrible
pirate, Thomas Tew, was one of those he
was sent to capture or to punish&mdash;but he never
found him. His crew became mutinous because
there was so little to do and it was during a
fight that Kidd struck his gunner, William
Moore, and killed him. It was really for that
act that the man was captured when he finally
returned to America, and he was sent eventually
to England to be tried for the killing of
Moore, rather than for piracy, although he did
do a little &lsquo;pirating&rsquo; on his voyages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was while he was in prison,&rdquo; Nicky took
up the story, &ldquo;he sent for one of my ancestors,
a New York merchant, and told him about the
treasure. He said&mdash;it&rsquo;s all preserved in writing
in my family&mdash;he said that while cruising in
the Gulf, during his trading and before he got
his commission from England as a privateersman,
he was blown by a heavy wind quite near
what we call the Florida Keys. When the
weather calmed there was a signal flying from
a coral rock and the Captain took off onto his
ship several castaways from a wreck. They
told him they had been on a Spanish treasure
ship, transporting gold and silver bars from
the Spanish settlements in Central America
when the hurricane wrecked their ship. Captain
Kidd said he had looked for the treasure
but there was no sign of any, and so he thought
they were telling falsehoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did he draw a map&mdash;if that was
what the map was about!&rdquo; Cliff interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man he had saved&mdash;one of the survivors&mdash;gave
him the map when he was injured by
a sabre wound and was dying. He said the
men had managed to swim ashore to some of
the smaller Keys when the ship ran onto some
needle-like coral and began to break up. But
they got a couple of boats overside too, and
when it was calmer, and the ship was breaking
apart and falling away into the water, they got
many chests of the treasure into the boats and
rowed along into the keys and hid the chests on
an island that was in the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Neale. &ldquo;Probably, by that
time, some of the other members of the crew
had gone back and found the chests.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;You see, when the
ancestor was given the map, he took a passage
on a ship to come and find the Jamaica governor,
but his ship was besieged by pirates and
he was taken by them&mdash;and it was years before
he got off their ship and back to civilization&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a story by itself, but I can&rsquo;t stop to tell
it to you now. Anyhow, he got back, but he had
no more taste for the sea and when he died he
passed on his map and the story, but nobody
else ever tried until my uncle got the paper.
He made a trip down here and found out just
what Sam told us&mdash;that the governor&rsquo;s paper
had been stolen. So, of course, he gave it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you propose to do?&rdquo; asked
Clarence Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray thinks we ought to talk to Sam
and offer to share with him fairly for the use
of his part of the map. He&rsquo;s on his way here,
or ought to be. I left word with Ma&rsquo;am Sib
to tell him to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he hasn&rsquo;t returned to get the message,&rdquo;
Mr. Gray said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said Nicky, unable to resist a little
malicious prod at Tom&rsquo;s fears, &ldquo;or maybe the
ghost got him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Tom could make a reply they heard
the patter of swift feet racing along the path
to the house; a voice cried out, shrill and excited,
&ldquo;Help&mdash;masters&mdash;help! De ghost&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>With a common impulse they all leaped to
their feet. In their excitement not one of them
stopped to catch up the map. They moved
closer together, Tom clutching Nicky&rsquo;s arm and
staring wide-eyed at the door.</p>
<p>Into their midst scampered the ten-year-old
colored boy of the morning experience. His
face was ashy colored under his dusky skin, and
his eyes rolled wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masters&mdash;masters!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Save
me&mdash;&rdquo; He lifted a finger, and pointed it
shakingly toward the doorway. They all stared
in that direction, and even Cliff felt the hair
prickling on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there! It&rsquo;s chased me&mdash;it&rsquo;s coming&mdash;&rdquo;
the boy gasped.</p>
<p>Clarence Neale leaped past the frightened
child, and on a sudden impulse Nicky, feeling
a strange hunch, swung part way around
toward the table. He meant to reach for the
map, forgotten in the instant of excitement.</p>
<p>In his turn he gave a gasping cry.</p>
<p>Their map was gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">&ldquo;NOTHING SHALL STOP US!&rdquo;</span></span></h2>
<p>Nicky wasted no time going around through
the door. He scrambled to the windowsill and
leaped out into the darkness. Springing clear
of the bushes which were planted close to the
house, he landed on his feet and looked hurriedly
about him.</p>
<p>Nothing was to be seen!</p>
<p>As soon as his eyes became used to the dark
he strained them in every direction. But there
was nothing to reward his eager eyes.</p>
<p>Finally, after poking around in the brush
just beyond the clearing in which the house
stood, he returned to his friends. The colored
boy was recovering slowly from the effects of
his terror. Tom, too, had regained some of his
usual steadiness, though he seemed to be much
more excited than either of his chums. The
older men had discovered the absence of the
map but had thought that Nicky took it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he panted, still laboring under his excitement
and his exertions in running from one
dump of brush to another, &ldquo;it was gone when
I looked around before I jumped through the
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did it go?&rdquo; demanded Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the puzzle,&rdquo; replied Clarence Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De ghos&rsquo; done taken it!&rdquo; gasped the small
colored boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort! There aren&rsquo;t any
ghosts!&rdquo; declared Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>The boy stared. &ldquo;Yes, they is!&rdquo; he retorted.
&ldquo;I seen it! It was white! It&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see it?&rdquo; Nicky asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By de window, sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it looking in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was comin&rsquo; to&rsquo;ds&rdquo;&mdash;toward, he meant&mdash;&ldquo;to&rsquo;ds
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; a new voice spoke. The
owner of the plantation, a rough, stocky Englishman
with a bronzed face, stood in the doorway.
He had been out on another of his many
properties for several days and had, apparently,
come back in time to discover the
excitement without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray explained the boy&rsquo;s fright without
mentioning the loss of the map. Nicky, about
to speak, saw Cliff make a gesture which unmistakably
was the Mystery Boys&rsquo; signal for
silence; he closed his lips and waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;These colored people are afraid of shadows,&rdquo;
said the plantation owner. &ldquo;Run along
home, boy. Nothing will hurt you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sar, Mister Coleson, sar, I dassent go
in de dark alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives of this island are full of legends
and stories about ghosts,&rdquo; Mr. Coleson explained
to the group. &ldquo;Why, I have even heard
them declare that the ghosts and spirits of the
old pirates appear at times. Joe, my overseer,
here on the plantation, says he once heard
where treasure was hidden and he decided to
try to get it. But when he got near the place
his superstitions got the best of him. The way
he tells about it, he saw pirates, in red bandana
head cloths, with glittering cutlasses, and
smoking pistols, stalking toward him. Naturally,
being a coward, he ran. Of course,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only telling you what he said.
Personally, I think the fellow built it all up
in his mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;sar!&rdquo; broke in the colored boy. &ldquo;No!
I see dem, too! I see Cap&rsquo;n Kidd in my dream,
de odder night. He come and he say &lsquo;Boo!&rsquo; an&rsquo;
wake me up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarence Neale laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows how easy it is to believe in
ghosts if you hear about them and think about
them all your life!&rdquo; he told Tom. &ldquo;This lad
even dreams about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Kidd, eh?&rdquo; repeated the Englishman,
laughing and then becoming half serious.
&ldquo;Well, if there&rsquo;s any truth in superstition, the
old boy must be watching over some of his
treasure that is threatened!&rdquo; He winked toward
Clarence Neale, but neither Tom nor the
colored boy saw it and both thought he was
quite serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, sar&mdash;please, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged the boy,
beginning to snivel. &ldquo;He say &lsquo;Boo&rsquo; at me. Den
I mus&rsquo; have see him, tonight again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Englishman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you
people to argue with this little scare-cat! I&rsquo;m
tired and I think I will turn in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said goodnight and went to the quarters
he occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Sam to come here?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was&mdash;&rdquo; began Cliff; he paused, and
glanced at Nicky. The latter opened his eyes
wider as the thought struck him too.</p>
<p>Could Sam have had anything to do with the
&ldquo;ghost business?&rdquo; Sam had half a map; he
saw Nicky, earlier, displaying his excitement
when the map was shown. Maybe he had become
suspicious, followed them, overheard
something; perhaps he had even listened at the
window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>They discussed the strange disappearance of
their map, stated their suspicions, brought up
the question of Sam&rsquo;s possible guilt.</p>
<p>The colored boy, not understanding, stood
with his eyes rolling, afraid to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an easy way to settle the question,
and, at the same time to dispose of this
boy&rsquo;s fears,&rdquo; suggested Clarence Neale. &ldquo;I
will walk home with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed to be the best course and so Mr.
Neale, reassuring their dusky charge, put a
hand on his shoulder and gently urged him
from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much for this situation,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gray. &ldquo;It seems to me that some human
agency is at work, trying to frighten you lads.
I assure you that there is no ghost. Whatever
Tom may have seen, and whatever the boy saw,
there is a human being behind it. And no
ghostly hands took your paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that way too,&rdquo; Nicky declared, and
Cliff nodded his agreement. Tom also gave a
rather lame assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; stated Nicky, practically, &ldquo;if
there was a ghost&mdash;if Captain Kidd did watch!&mdash;he
sent part of the map to my own ancestor.
He wouldn&rsquo;t want to scare us! If he scared
anybody, or took a map from anywhere, he
would go after the colored fellow, Sam. His
half of the cipher wasn&rsquo;t rightfully his, the way
mine is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no ghost,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Gray.
&ldquo;If you ever get the true facts you will see that
some person is at the bottom of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, most likely!&rdquo; declared Tom, entering
into the spirit of the discussion and reassuring
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Neale, coming in, his arm
around the shoulders of the colored man they
had just named, &ldquo;no&mdash;Sam isn&rsquo;t at the bottom
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at Sam. He was weak and
shaken, and slumped down in a chair, rather
limp and groggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found Sam out by the gate,&rdquo; Mr. Neale
explained. &ldquo;He had been knocked out, actually,
by a blow. He was on his way here, he managed
to tell me. He thought he saw something light-colored
near the house and he stopped by the
gate. But whatever&mdash;whoever&mdash;it was, disappeared
behind the house and he stood a moment
wondering. Then he heard the voice in the
house, here, and wondered whether to come in
or to wait. Before he guessed what was happening,
some one was behind him and struck
him. That is all he remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ghost did that!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;know,&rdquo; Sam said, weakly. &ldquo;They
tell, on the island, that ghosts have terrible
power. I never did believe much in it, but&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do know!&rdquo; declared Mr. Neale defiantly.
&ldquo;Your part of the map is gone, of
course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! Does that seem like the work
of a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be!&rdquo; Sam said uncertainly. He
drank the water Nicky had brought him, and
seemed to be pulling himself together, but his
age-old instinct of fear was beginning to
triumph over his education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; Mr. Gray summed up, &ldquo;whatever
and whoever did these things, the result
amounts to this: neither Sam nor we have any
clue to the treasure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t let that stop you, would you?&rdquo;
demanded Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, if Father would let us go on,&rdquo;
Cliff stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed Clarence Neale. &ldquo;We can
remember the map closely enough&mdash;we know
the longitude&mdash;we could even cable Nicky&rsquo;s
uncle and get the original if necessary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t remember the latitude on
Sam&rsquo;s half,&rdquo; said Cliff. &ldquo;Unless Sam does&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;When he gets over his bump&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be
serious&mdash;he will be able to help. Anyway, we
know in a general way that the place is somewhere
in the Florida Keys, about twenty-five
degrees and some minutes of North latitude
and we all recall the longitude&mdash;and one-half
of the map had the phrase &lsquo;dip&rsquo; and the other
&lsquo;per&rsquo;&mdash;put them together and they mean &lsquo;Dipper.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Mr. Neale sketched on a bit of envelope
the picture of the constellation know as &ldquo;The
Dipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, triumphantly. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
that show you the same little marks that were
on the two maps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky, Cliff, Tom and Mr. Gray nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we can find that set of islands,&rdquo;
declared Mr. Neale, &ldquo;and, if Mr. Gray would
carry on my work here, I, for one, would vote
to go ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here too!&rdquo; cried Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same for me!&rdquo; stated Cliff, giving his
father an imploring look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; Tom chimed in, not as aggressively,
but with his will power overcoming
his uncertainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go if you would let me,&rdquo; said Sam, while
Mr. Gray bandaged a lump on his head after
it had been disinfected and washed. &ldquo;I know
where I could get a sloop with a little engine
to kick it along if the wind failed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky. &ldquo;I
vote we take Sam in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share and share alike!&rdquo; cried Cliff eagerly.
&ldquo;That is, our part of whatever we find! Of
course we&rsquo;d give some to the governor&rsquo;s family
if we can find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to keep it secret&mdash;our plan!&rdquo;
said Nicky, earnestly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to pretend
to be going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To cruise for Carib relics on smaller
islands!&rdquo; broke in Clarence Neale, as excited as
his younger companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; agreed Nicky. &ldquo;Is the sloop big
enough, Sam? Where is it? What&rsquo;s it like?
Is it seaworthy for a cruise like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and described the one-masted,
thirty-foot boat with its heavy duty
motor. &ldquo;Maybe close quarters to sleep in,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but she has shorely got a good name
for treasure hunting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded all three chums in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Treasure Belle</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;With a name like that
we simply must get her! Mr. Gray, you can&rsquo;t
refuse us permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three eager youths pleaded. The older man,
counseled and reassured by Clarence Neale,
finally agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Nicky exulted. &ldquo;Treasure bent
in the <i>Treasure Belle</i>! Nothing can stop us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom, a little silent, hoped that nothing
could!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">ON THE WAY TO THE KEYS</span></span></h2>
<p>The <i>Treasure Belle</i>, when they inspected her
with Sam and Mr. Neale, disappointed the
chums. She lay, careening to one side, in a
place on the shore of a small ship basin. Her
hull, originally painted white, was a mixture of
grays and browns, streaked and dirty. Her
cabin, when they crawled into it, was musty and
cramped, up in the bow, with no head room
and with its bunks both narrow and uninviting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a difference between her name and
her looks,&rdquo; smiled Clarence Neale. Nicky
nodded and Cliff, standing on deck, pointed
toward a cluster of boats moored in deeper
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we charter a boat like that one?&rdquo;
said Cliff, indicating a fairly trim looking
cruising launch, about thirty feet long, with a
raised cabin whose windows had neat little
drapings at each side, whose paint showed little
wear. Where the <i>Treasure Belle</i> had no bright
work, her hardware being discolored and rusting,
the other craft showed signs of constant
attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a private boat, and not for hire, sar,&rdquo;
explained Sam. &ldquo;She belong to a white man.
He use her for run to Cuba. I hear it told he
is a politician of Cuba, and he stay here because
he is not so well liked in his island. But they
say he run there by night for some reason and
keep that boat only for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he would charter her to us if he
didn&rsquo;t need her,&rdquo; urged Nicky. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be a
lot nicer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam, at Mr. Neale&rsquo;s suggestion, took them to
the office of the ship basin owners but they got
no encouragement. The <i>El Libertad</i> was not
for hire or charter. He gave the party the
address of her owner readily enough but without
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>When Mr. Neale returned from an interview
with Senor Ortiga, he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>El Libertad</i> is not to be ours,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Senor Ortiga told me that he is having the
engine overhauled and is waiting for parts&mdash;even
if he would let us have her, which he did
not seem inclined to do, it would be a month
before she would be ready, he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>Treasure Belle</i> look poorly,&rdquo; Sam said.
&ldquo;But she is Bahama built, sar, and she&rsquo;s sturdy,
and seaworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;She looks like a tub with a sail,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar, but she has very light draught,&rdquo;
Sam urged. &ldquo;She can go in channels between
the cays, and if she get aground her hull is
strong and not easy to break. That <i>Libertad</i> is
very thin hulled, and draws eight inches more
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t have her, anyway,&rdquo; Nicky
decided. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make the best of this
one and let the name make up for the drawbacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin own her,&rdquo; Sam stated. &ldquo;I have
not told him why we charter her, and for the
cruise to get relics that I say we use her for,
he let her go very cheap, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made the necessary arrangements with
Sam&rsquo;s cousin and work was started on the
sloop. She was close to thirty-two feet in length,
wide in her beam and squatty looking, but her
engine, though a heavy duty make and not very
fast, was in perfect trim. Her canvas was also
neat and complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>While the paint was scrubbed and the dirty
interior of the cabin made presentable and as
comfortable as possible, Sam, who was a good
sailor and knew the sloop well, gave Nicky,
Tom and Cliff many lessons in rope splicing,
handling the sails, and, without actual practice
in steering he explained the method of holding
a small craft on her course. Sam was the only
addition to the party, as, with Mr. Neale, who
was sufficiently good at navigation to handle a
small boat on the comparatively landlocked
course they would take, it was felt that the
boys would make a sufficient crew, standing
watch-and-watch.</p>
<p>Few supplies were put aboard. They did not
want people to suppose they were going to be
on a desolate series of coral reefs for their
cruise; to buy much food would arouse curiosity,
because they could get fresh supplies on
any of the islands of the Bahamas or the Virgin
Islands they were hinting that they would visit.</p>
<p>On a bright, clear morning Cliff bade goodbye
to his father, the others shook hands with
Mr. Gray, and with the <i>Treasure Belle&rsquo;s</i> engine
thudding away without a skip, they maneuvered
the sloop out of the small basin and laid a
course for Cuba, steering for the Eastern end
of the island rather than to their true course
toward the Western end, so as to make it seem
that they were bound toward the Eastern group
of islands, after touching on the large island
for some work Mr. Neale pretended must be
done there to verify some reports of Carib
relics to be found in the jungles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>But by noon, with the jib and mainsail spread
to the steady breeze, they shifted the tiller and
brought the <i>Treasure Belle</i> around again on a
course that would enable them to round the
Western nose of Cuba and then sail Northeast
to the coral islets which clustered in a long
fringe along the Florida Gulf coast, at its lower
portion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a map we will have to take some
chances,&rdquo; Mr. Neale told Nicky, Tom and Cliff.
&ldquo;But we can come pretty close to a guess at
the point where we must anchor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where our half of the map showed the
crossmarked &lsquo;reck,&rsquo;&rdquo; Nicky asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Neale. &ldquo;We will hunt for
a spot where there could be a set of conditions
like those we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that there must be needles of
coral deep enough for a Spanish galleon to
have gone aground and broken up,&rdquo; Cliff suggested.
&ldquo;Then two islands with a channel deep
enough between for a heavy boat to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; nodded the captain of the vessel,
for that post had been given to their older comrade.
The Mystery Boys had given Mr. Neale
his initiation into the secret gestures with
which they could communicate without letting
outsiders guess that they were doing so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will work in through the keys with
the light-draft, glass-bottomed boat we are towing,&rdquo;
the captain went on. &ldquo;If we fail to find
islands in a formation like the Great Dipper,
we can work North and South alternately until
we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, the treasure!&rdquo; exulted Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;Centuries
have passed since it was put there. The map
didn&rsquo;t show whether the treasure was buried
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it could have been,&rdquo; Tom
declared. &ldquo;That coral is too hard to dig in.
They&rsquo;d have had to blast to get a place deep
enough to bury it. I imagine they just lowered
the chests into the water, maybe in a little cove
or where there was a hole deep enough to conceal
the chests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to see,&rdquo; Mr. Neale agreed.
&ldquo;First we must find our Great Dipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made the end of Cuba without any
difficulty, rounded it and set the tiller for the
new course, sailing more slowly as they lost the
direct force of the steady breeze and had to
keep rather close-hauled. They did not use
the engine, preferring not to employ it any
more than was essential. It might help them
off if they ran onto a reef, and they proposed
to save their supply of gasoline for such an
emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>At last, under a glorious sunset, with its rose
and coral, its great, vivid bands of green and
vivid gold lighting up a few fleecy clouds near
the horizon, they sighted the low, long cluster
of islets.</p>
<p>Not a thing had occurred during the trip to
cause uneasiness. Sam had been both courteous
and respectful, without being servile. Like
most Jamaica colored people he felt himself to
be the equal of the race of lighter color, as far
as education and morality could be compared.
In the matter of his color of skin he felt, with
justice, that the teaching of the Bible, and of
the United States Constitution, that all men are
equal, in the sense of all being created by the
same Great Creator, was a true teaching.</p>
<p>Being sensible boys, Nicky, Tom and Cliff
made no distinction in the matter of Sam&rsquo;s
color. As long as he preserved the same habits
of decency as they did, as long as he &ldquo;acted
white,&rdquo; as Nicky put it, they were too finely
bred to treat him like an ignorant heathen, as
so many rather ignorant people do in their
relations with men of dark, or yellow skin.
They looked at the intelligence and the inner
man, and not alone at the tint of the skin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Sam felt the decent attitude and responded.
He never tried to be above his station but he
acted as an equal wherever his education enabled
him to do so, and accepted gracefully the
superiority of Mr. Neale&rsquo;s training, Nicky&rsquo;s
deftness with a fish spear, Nicky&rsquo;s eyes having
been quickened and trained by archery and
other sports. Tom&rsquo;s superior speed as a runner
had been proved on the beach before they
sailed, as had Cliff&rsquo;s supremacy in wrestling.
But there was no color line drawn, and that
made the cruise more pleasanter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Keys!&rdquo; cried Nicky from the bow.</p>
<p>They all lined up around the mast, and, just
before the twilight and its afterglow left the
long reach of islets looking like ghostly shapes
on the water, they cast anchor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">AN UNCANNY SUMMONS</span></span></h2>
<p>The spot where the <i>Treasure Belle</i> came to
anchor was just at the lowermost point of the
archipelago of coral islets. The solid land
which had Cape Sable for its most Southern
tip had been passed and lay to their left, while
the first of the Keys was dimly visible as they
looked off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>A council was being held on the decked-over
top of the stuffy cabin. Sam was not there. He
had taken the dinghy, with its glass bottom,
and was just out of earshot toward the inner
bay, fishing to secure their morning meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking a great deal about our
next course,&rdquo; Mr. Neale stated. &ldquo;One reason
that I anchored just here is this: It is a deep
enough channel between the mainland and the
Key for us to navigate the <i>Belle</i> without
danger of grounding or running onto a coral
&lsquo;needle.&rsquo; My intention has been to sail along
the outer side of the archipelago; but I wonder,
now, what you think of trying the inside channel,
between the mainland and the Keys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d miss the place where the wreck was
marked, if we go the inside way,&rdquo; objected
Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted the captain, &ldquo;but, on the
on the other hand, fellows, we would come to a
point opposite where we think that should be,
and we&rsquo;d work outward from the inner channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d miss the route we marked down,
from memory, the way it was on our half of
the map. That took in at least two of the
Dipper islands,&rdquo; Cliff reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is my reason for wanting to do something
else,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said quietly. &ldquo;If we go
the outer way there may not be a safe anchorage
in case of a storm. You will remember
that the old galleon was supposed to have been
wrecked on &lsquo;needles&rsquo; and I can assure you that
those sharp, coral spikes are no pleasant thing
to have under your hull in any sea that lifts the
sloop and drops her down hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know another good reason,&rdquo; Tom chimed
in. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t suspect Sam of having anything
to do with stealing our map&mdash;because he
was hit on the head and his map was taken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he says!&rdquo; corrected Nicky. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
any proof, and he&rsquo;s the only one we can think
of who would have had any reason&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t actually suspect him,&rdquo; Tom
insisted. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t made a suspicions move
or done a wrong thing since we started out. But
what I meant to say was: We don&rsquo;t suspect
him, but we do know that somebody has the
maps&mdash;both halves, probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are driving at,&rdquo; Cliff declared.
&ldquo;If somebody else is after the treasure,
we would be right in sight if we anchored in
the outer place; and we&rsquo;d be a sort of &lsquo;marker&rsquo;
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my idea, also,&rdquo; said Mr. Neale.
&ldquo;And if Sam did have anything to do with the
loss of our map, a change in our plans may
cause him to betray some emotion. We can&rsquo;t
suspect him, but we can&rsquo;t exonerate him,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; agreed Nicky, and Tom and Cliff
shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote for the inside channel,&rdquo; Nicky added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too,&rdquo; Cliff completed the vote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, tomorrow, we will pilot the <i>Belle</i>
through by using the dinghy ahead to look out
for coral,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not mention it to Sam in the dark,&rdquo;
Nicky urged. &ldquo;His face will show his feelings
better in the morning and we will surprise
him.&rdquo; It was agreed to take Nicky&rsquo;s way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;over there!&rdquo; Tom said under his
breath; he clutched Cliff&rsquo;s arm, and pointed.
They all turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean on that little Key&mdash;where the
single tree is&mdash;that bluish light!&rdquo; Nicky demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Isn&rsquo;t it queer? See&mdash;Mr. Neale! It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s clutch on Cliff&rsquo;s arm tightened.</p>
<p>On the small expanse of coral at some distance,
countless years had spread a thin upper
covering of mold and dust until enough earth
was deposited to support a small, stunted palm
tree. As the four looked a strange, bluish
radiance, seeming to be on the ground itself,
showed the lower part of the tree trunk in relief
against its faint glow.</p>
<p>The light seemed to move about within a narrow
radius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can hardly be phosphorus,&rdquo; stated Mr.
Neale, keeping his voice low and his words calm
to prevent any growth of superstitious fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; whispered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam may be over there,&rdquo; Nicky gave the
logical explanation. But as he spoke they
heard the swish of Sam&rsquo;s oar and the grate of
the dinghy coming alongside on the port side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; cautioned Cliff. &ldquo;See
if he mentions it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam did mention the light, and at once!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that, sar,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Neale,
as he paid out the dinghy line and looped it
over a stern cleat of the sloop. &ldquo;I tell you, sar,
I was educated not to believe in ghosts, sar,
but we are right in the place where all the
pirates hid gold and laid in wait for ships. If
not the English and Spanish and French, then
the Bahama buccaneers and the ones that
started up their trade from Cuba before they
were wiped out for all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Neale, rather sharply.
&ldquo;Pull up that dinghy, Nicky. Want to come
along? We&rsquo;ll see what it&rsquo;s all about, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sar&mdash;don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam.</p>
<p>Tom also whispered to Nicky. The latter,
rather surprised at his formerly cool chum,
who had kept his head admirably during their
adventures among the Incas, was about to make
a retort that would shame Tom, but he shut his
lips, for once controlling his impulses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to fear,&rdquo; declared the captain
and Nicky echoed his words stoutly, as did
Cliff. Nicky and Mr. Neale rowed away.</p>
<p>It was a short row to the islet, although they
proceeded slowly because of the darkness and
the proximity of coral under the water. The
light disappeared before they reached the
island. They could see quite plainly in the starlight
that there was nothing on the small coral
Key except the palm tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; observed Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was just some odd reflection of
light from a star on the coral,&rdquo; Nicky said.
&ldquo;Only&mdash;it moved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps our imagination helped,&rdquo; Mr.
Neale said, and that was the explanation he
insisted upon when they returned to the <i>Treasure
Belle</i>. The others accepted it, Cliff calmly,
Tom rather silently. Only Sam objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No star, sar!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We would still
see the light&mdash;and no star is blue. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew closer to the little riding light which
was on the mast and which they used as their
only illumination that evening. &ldquo;Back in my
island there is a story, sar, that when a treasure
is in danger ghosts appear to scare people
away and when a treasure is not being guarded
by ghosts there is a light hovering over the spot
where it is buried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is great!&rdquo; declared Nicky eagerly.
&ldquo;All we have to do then is to go there tomorrow
and get the treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although neither Tom nor Sam fully agreed
that there was nothing to menace their personal
welfare, they retired with the others. Sam
curled up, as usual, in the cockpit, and the three
chums laid themselves on the roof of the cabin,
on blankets, their air pillows inflated and under
their heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>They did not discuss the matter of the light.
It did not appear again and Nicky and Cliff
dropped off to sleep. Tom, lying awake, battling
with himself mentally, trying to make his
common sense defeat his instinctive apprehension,
started and almost thrust Cliff over the
low rail with the violence of his motion.</p>
<p>From somewhere about the hull of their sloop
came three distinct taps! Rap! Rap! Rap!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; whispered Tom.</p>
<p>Mr. Neale, seated near the tiller, half dozing,
answered, as Cliff and Nicky stirred and
came awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably drifting wood or possibly we are
almost on a coral reef&mdash;or the anchor cable may
have rubbed and made the noise. There is not
a thing!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; gasped Nicky&mdash;&ldquo;Look! In the
water! Light&mdash;bluish light, moving away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was fully awake and staring in
every direction. Cliff located Nicky&rsquo;s indicating
finger, followed the direction, saw a swirl
of phosphorescence in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a shark!&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;a shark came
up to investigate us, looking for food, I&rsquo;ll bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was it!&rdquo; declared Mr. Neale. &ldquo;Go back
to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the light again!&rdquo; Tom quavered.
Even Cliff and Nicky felt chilling prickles run
up and down their spines at Tom&rsquo;s tone. Sam
looked and slumped down, hiding his face in
the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s&mdash;hit&rsquo;s&mdash;ghos&rsquo;es!&rdquo; he shuddered, forgetting
his educated diction in his terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Neale, let&rsquo;s go and see&mdash;&rdquo; begged Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go too?&rdquo; urged Cliff, &ldquo;Nicky went
last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till mornin&rsquo;&mdash;please, sar, wait!&rdquo;
pleaded Sam. &ldquo;Doan&rsquo; leave us here for the
ghos&rsquo;es to git us, sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;right now, we go!&rdquo; stated Nicky.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll settle this thing once and for all. If
you aren&rsquo;t strong enough to fight off a ghost,
Sam, I&rsquo;m sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had the dinghy alongside. Cliff and Mr.
Neale clambered in and held the rail of the
sloop until Nicky slipped into the dinghy&rsquo;s bow.
Tom, knowing the small boat had its full complement
of passengers, and realizing that his
own timidity had made him an enforced companion
of a terrified Negro on the sloop, strove
to drive away his fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you whistle, sar?&rdquo; urged Sam. &ldquo;Dey
says whistlin&rsquo; keeps off ghos&rsquo;es!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you try, too,&rdquo; ordered Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Both puckered their lips and essayed a shrill
whistle. It came out each a quavery, hissing
failure that the ones in the boat, pushing away
from the sloop, peered and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get yourself a tin whistle,&rdquo; laughed Cliff,
and even Tom had to chuckle at his own tremulous
muscles.</p>
<p>It seemed as though the dinghy was away a
long time; the queer light shone for awhile but
suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>After a wait there came a hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we found?&rdquo; called Nicky,
excitedly.</p>
<p>Tom couldn&rsquo;t guess. When they all assembled
and the riding lantern was hauled down
to show their discovery better, Tom gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right where the light had been, we found
this!&rdquo; stated Nicky, showing a rusted, broken
and almost completely disintegrated old can,
such as vegetables are preserved in. From it
he drew an old, torn slip of some sort of thin
leather or parchment. Time seemed to have
eaten into it, or else the washing of the water
had rotted it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, faint, distinguishable marks
were on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a message or something!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s what the light was for,&rdquo; said Sam,
his teeth chattering. &ldquo;It marked where the can
was, sars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did us a good turn,&rdquo; Nicky stated
joyfully. &ldquo;Read it, will you, Mr. Neale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their captain put the parchment very close
to the light.</p>
<p>They almost held their breath, waiting in a
thrill of eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it looks as old as the
can&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;this is a message to
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is?&rdquo; shouted Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; He bent closer, holding the dim
lettering almost against the lantern globe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what it says. &lsquo;Treasure&mdash;found&mdash;long
ago. Dig under tallest of three trees on
Crocodile Key in Card Bay for more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Nicky exulted, &ldquo;one treasure gone
and another to be found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo; Cliff asked. &ldquo;I
know how we found it, but I mean, how did it
get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was left here for some buccaneers
who knew about the other treasure,&rdquo; Tom hazarded
a guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the answer,&rdquo; Nicky cried, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t
meant for us. There may have been a treasure
hidden on that key; somebody got it and either
took it where this says, or else knew of another
one and left this word for the ones who would
come for the original one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;the light!&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Nicky, &ldquo;if ghosts want to be
as friendly as to light a beacon, I&rsquo;m their
friend! Thank you, ghosties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo; whispered Sam. &ldquo;Please, sar&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did us a favor,&rdquo; said Nicky. &ldquo;They
gave us a much better &lsquo;lead&rsquo; than the one we
had. I say it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He faced the little key and cupping his hands,
sent out a hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosties&mdash;thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Nicky was electrified in the next instant.</p>
<p>From somewhere&mdash;they could not say where&mdash;came
a sephulchral, gurgling answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;welcome!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">CROCODILE KEY</span></span></h2>
<p>Like a jackrabbit, Sam, in two moves, dived
into the cabin. His first jump took him from
the deck to the cockpit; his body hardly landed,
facing astern, before he doubled on himself,
snakelike, and shot himself through the narrow
door.</p>
<p>Tom was on the point of following; but his
fear of his comrades&rsquo; laughter was greater even
than his dread of the unknown. Sam&rsquo;s comical
appearance brought a shout of laughter from
Cliff and Nicky; even Mr. Neale was compelled
to chuckle. Tom, therefore, mastered his impulse
and remained on the cabin roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you suppose that was?&rdquo; Cliff
wondered, after they relieved the tension of the
momentary start of instinctive terror by a good
laugh at Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must give it up,&rdquo; answered Mr. Neale,
&ldquo;but I am inclined to look for some human
agency before I admit any supernatural cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t sound like&mdash;anything human!&rdquo;
Tom said with a shiver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard so many ghosts that you
know what they sound like?&rdquo; asked Nicky with
a chuckle. Tom shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel much like investigating in the
dark,&rdquo; Cliff went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what there is to investigate,&rdquo;
Nicky added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the dinghy in the morning and look
for some evidences of human causes,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Neale. &ldquo;Perhaps a Seminole Indian may
be around here, fishing&mdash;or something. Or some
white resident of the mainland, with a sense
of humor, is playing a joke on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This message doesn&rsquo;t seem like a joke,&rdquo;
Nicky defended. &ldquo;It looks real to me. See how
rusted the old can is&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s almost like
paper&mdash;and the parchment is awfully old.&rdquo; He
indicated, by the dim lantern, how frail the
edge of the sheet was by tearing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s real,&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you,
Mr. Neale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their captain and mentor hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several strange points to consider
by daylight,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;If we had
found it by chance I should consider it genuine;
but the light&mdash;and the ghostly voice&mdash;those
make me suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;look!&rdquo; argued Nicky, &ldquo;it gives a definite
place, and tells about a landmark to show
where to dig for treasure. Our map wasn&rsquo;t even
clear about the channel or where the treasure
was hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said, &ldquo;it came to you
in a logical way. The new one did not. I cannot
account for that bluish light but it is surely
not supernatural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of very old things, decomposing,
giving off light,&rdquo; Cliff declared. Mr. Neale
nodded and since there was really nothing to be
gained by any long argument, they finally became
calm enough to lie down again, Mr. Neale
agreeing to stay awake and watch until dawn.</p>
<p>Not much sleep was possible; nevertheless
they all dozed some, and their dreams were, to
say the least, thrilling.</p>
<p>However, as is usual with any form of terror
of supernatural things, the coming of the sunshine
dispelled their timidity. True it was that
the coral showed no footprints and the water
told no story of the previous night&rsquo;s incidents.
They remained unexplainable.</p>
<p>Sam served a breakfast of fish, with bacon
and some turtle eggs he had found the evening
before, and during the meal their procedure
was discussed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Nicky, Cliff and Tom were for giving up their
indefinite search, among a multitude of islets,
and trying for the new treasure trove, and Sam
agreed with them with the words, &ldquo;Anywhere,
sar&mdash;anywhere but hereabouts! It&rsquo;s bad lucky,
so it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Neale, outvoted, gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hunted crocodiles for the Museum of
Natural History one winter,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;I did
not secure a really successful specimen&mdash;all I
got was a giant turtle head, and part of the
skeleton of some great snake; the crocodiles
were too shy to be caught or even shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean alligators?&rdquo; asked Tom,
who knew some natural history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Neale. &ldquo;Mostly the saurians
of Florida are of the alligator family; but in
some southerly parts of the Florida bays there
are to be found certain species that are different
from the alligators and more closely allied
with the crocodile species. I really believe
it would do us no harm to delay our search
here for a while. There is delightful fishing
and a great deal of fun&mdash;good bathing, sponge
fishing, crawfish catching and so on&mdash;to be had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Card Bay,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is a curious slip
in the parchment; it is really Card Sound&mdash;a
sheet of water about six miles by two and a
half. But possibly when this parchment was
put where we found it&mdash;if it is genuine&mdash;the
names were different.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Up came the anchor and instead of running
into Whitewater Bay to go up the channel&mdash;if
they could find one&mdash;inside the islets, they
swung the <i>Treasure Belle&rsquo;s</i> bow southward,
and ran slowly down to round the land of the
nose named Cape Sable, and then beat easterly
along the coast, finding snug harbors behind
keys or in some of the many small bays, to lie
to during the nights.</p>
<p>The trip was fairly uneventful.</p>
<p>There was one time when they thought they
would not find the right channel and almost
went aground in a narrow passage between
two mangrove-covered points. Rather heavy
wind made steering hard as they rounded
Southeast Cape, the lowest part of the Florida
mainland, even before that; but Sam was a
good man at the tiller and they had little to
fear, being quick and alert to obey his quiet
commands to haul on the ropes, to swing the
mainsail or to take an additional reef in their
canvas.</p>
<p>They skirted the shore of lower Matecumbe,
and stared interestedly at Indian Key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is where the Seminole Indians killed
a Doctor Perrine,&rdquo; Mr. Neale explained. &ldquo;During
the Seminole War that happened. His children
hid in a turtle pen. They escaped. Really,
it was a miracle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>It was a high island of about ten acres, and
in the plentiful water around it they ran quite
close to its high banks in passing.</p>
<p>That evening they anchored after running
between two points where the draught was very
slight and only by judging the color of the
water were they able to starboard, or port, the
helm a trifle, moving slowly, to avoid the shoal
or the more dangerous coral itself.</p>
<p>They anchored just before sunset and so
beautifully clear was the water that the sponges
growing on the bottom were plainly visible, in
the cross light, as Tom and Nicky rowed the
glass bottomed dinghy slowly around on the
smooth water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this great&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky. &ldquo;See
those sponges! How many kinds do you know,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know them by name, but not by
sight,&rdquo; Tom responded. &ldquo;I have read that the
marketable kinds are the yellow, the sheeps-wool,
the gras&mdash;and I think one is called the
glove. But there are more kinds that aren&rsquo;t
any good to sell, and they have to be recognized
or else you&rsquo;d get a lot that aren&rsquo;t salable. There
is the loggerhead, for one, I remember&mdash;and
the potato sponge. And there are some that
are spiny, and they hurt your hands if you
grab them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look like what we see in the
stores,&rdquo; Nicky commented. &ldquo;They are sort of
the same shapes, but they are black, and Mr.
Neale says they feel like india-rubber to touch
and they are smooth, with little craters or holes
in the top&mdash;look! There&rsquo;s a beauty. Is that
a salable one, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom peered down through the boat&rsquo;s transparent
bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s a sheeps-wool one,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Nicky stood up and began to fling off his
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dive for it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
Tom, fired by his enthusiasm, and with the
spirit of rivalry, began to &ldquo;shuck&rdquo; his clothes.
It became a race toward nakedness&mdash;with no
one but their comrades to observe, they often
plunged into the limpid, translucent water in
nature&rsquo;s swimming suit. Cliff, observing them
from the sloop, began to emulate their hasty
disrobing. But Sam put a stop to their plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Cliff, rather warmly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not afraid of sharks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sar,&rdquo; called Sam, &ldquo;but you are liable
to dive crooked or if your foot slips you may
go in backwards&mdash;and a cut from that sharp
coral isn&rsquo;t to be chanced, sar.&rdquo; He showed Cliff
a deep scar under his wooly hair, and Cliff,
alarmed, called for his comrades to desist&mdash;until
daylight, at least. They agreed reluctantly,
and, looking down more carefully Nicky confided
to Tom that he was glad they had. Overlooked
in their excitement, they were able in
calm study to observe a long, arrow-like frond
of coral extending upward at an angle so close
to the sponge that it must have been struck by
any but a most expert diver.</p>
<p>Green turtle, cooked by broiling beside a
good beach fire, as the Indians did it&mdash;a tasty
meat, and equally good when made into a sort
of stew of the whole creature&rsquo;s flesh, was eked
out by a four pound crawfish caught by Nicky
from a veritable crawling mass of these lobster-like
shellfish in their bay. Corn-pone, or
cornbread made the southern way and baked
in ashes, a process learned by Tom during a
summer camp, in the South, made a fine dinner
that night and they ate the more lustily for the
realization of their narrow escape earlier in the
evening. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t pay to leap before you
look!&rdquo; declared Nicky as the chums settled
down to sleep that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>After rather eventless days, during which
they passed many bays, inlets, keys and reefs,
they sighted Key Largo, one of the most fertile
of the few larger Florida Keys, beat along
its shore, ran along past Whaleback Key, and
finally slipped to the end of what the natives
call Barnes&rsquo; Sound, and through Jewfish Creek,
a narrow and deceptive passage connecting the
larger sheet of water with what the natives
call Little Card Sound, although the Geodetic
Survey charts give different names to both
major and minor waters.</p>
<p>The opening of Jewfish Creek was deceptive
because mangrove trees grew so closely that it
looked like an impassable place until Mr. Neale,
who had used it previously during his crocodile
hunting expedition, took command and piloted
them through cleverly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Card Sound!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky&mdash;with
considerable eagerness. &ldquo;Now&mdash;where is Crocodile
Key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of it,&rdquo; Mr. Neale replied.
&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder&mdash;yonder!&rdquo; cried Sam, extending his
arm toward a point on the distant shoreline.
&ldquo;That may not be a key, sar&mdash;but there shorely
are three trees in a row!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are!&rdquo; agreed the captain, jamming
over the tiller as the sloop heeled in the breeze
and swung her bow toward the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are on the shore&mdash;not on a key,&rdquo;
objected Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coral may have closed a channel during the
years,&rdquo; Mr. Neale explained. &ldquo;Then earth covered
it. That is, granting that our message is
genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;The trees prove it!&rdquo; Nicky cried. &ldquo;Now, all
we have to do is to wait till tomorrow and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig for treasure!&rdquo; cried Tom and Cliff, together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">BLACK CAESAR&rsquo;S BUCCANEERS</span></span></h2>
<p>Once the anchor was dropped and the sails
furled, and everything made ship-shape for an
indefinite stay, the chums lost no time in tumbling
into their dinghy and rowing the several
hundred yards to shore.</p>
<p>They wanted to inspect the small inlet opposite
which they had anchored, and, before the
light faded, to get an idea of what sort of a
place lay beneath those three sentinels standing
their silent guard over the treasure buried
so long ago.</p>
<p>The mouth of the inlet was dark and gloomy
when they reached it and Tom, using the oars,
let them trail in the water until the snub-nosed
boat lost way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks pretty spooky in there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky, &ldquo;pull, Tom.
There aren&rsquo;t any spooks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are snakes&mdash;and plenty of them,&rdquo;
Cliff came to the rescue of the oarsman. &ldquo;Mr.
Neale warned us, and it&rsquo;s getting close to sunset.
We might not see them&mdash;the snakes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Nicky gave in and they drifted close in to the
narrow waterway. The shore was heavily
matted with a jungle of undergrowth, above
which the larger growth, some small mahogany,
mangrove and other trees towered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be just a lagoon, not an inlet. If
it&rsquo;s a&mdash;er&mdash;like a strait, you know,&rdquo; Nicky
urged, &ldquo;then&rsquo;s there may be water enough on
the far side to make this a key. In that case&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
got the very place mentioned in the message!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wait till morning to make sure,&rdquo;
Cliff said, and after many speculations as to
which side of the trees the treasure lay under&mdash;the
message had not said&mdash;they rowed back to
the sloop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another boat&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s making
for the <i>Treasure Belle</i>,&rdquo; said Cliff. Looking
across the small distance, the others saw a rowboat
coming from around a point, making at
leisurely speed for the spot they had their bow
pointed toward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who they are?&rdquo; Nicky speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they wonder that about us,&rdquo; Tom
hinted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>They were aboard when the other small craft
slipped alongside. In the rowboat was a tall,
rangy, and very thin and hawk-faced white
man and a plumb, grinning darkey of the true
southern type, ready to break into a guffaw at
the slightest joke; he was quite a contrast to
the Jamaican, Sam. Although Sam had a pleasant
smile, his face never broke out, as Nicky
put it, &ldquo;like the sun bu&rsquo;sting through a cloud,&rdquo;
as did that of the darkey whom his white companion
called &ldquo;Pomp&rsquo;&rdquo; to shorten his real
name, which was Pompey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, strangers,&rdquo; greeted the white man
as their boat grated and came to rest at the
side of the sloop. &ldquo;Right pretty name your
boat&rsquo;s got&mdash;<i>Treasure Belle</i>. Reckon maybe you
named her that a-purpose. Reckon maybe you
come here-&rsquo;bouts to make her live up to hit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aboard, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mr. Neale responded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to have company and
get acquainted.&rdquo; The white man clambered to
the cockpit and produced a corncob pipe, filling
it languidly as he lay sprawled on a long
cushion at the side of the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nelse Carford,&rdquo; he explained and introductions
were exchanged. &ldquo;I got me a right
nice little piece of ground up beyond the point.
You-all mus&rsquo; come to visit me. Here for the
night&mdash;or on special business?&rdquo; It struck Nicky
and his comrades that he eyed them all closely
as he asked the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;we would be glad to visit you
soon, if we remain.&rdquo; Mr. Neale took it upon
himself to be the spokesman. &ldquo;We are just sailing
around among the bays and the keys, giving
the boys a bit of fun&mdash;an epidemic of &lsquo;flu&rsquo;
closed their school this December.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Nelse, apparently better
pleased than before. &ldquo;I thought it mought&mdash;&rdquo;
his word for &ldquo;might&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;mought be you was
after some treasure, seeing what the craft is
named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky opened his mouth, but Cliff kicked his
shin gently and Nicky subsided. But Nelse had
caught his expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it mought be your aim to git some
if it was right handy though, hey?&rdquo; he grinned.
Pompey, in the rowboat, holding to a rail alongside
the cockpit, guffawed, &ldquo;Sho&rsquo; nuff!&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;White boys sho&rsquo; nuff do dat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you blame us?&rdquo; Cliff demanded with
a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not,&rdquo; Nelse answered. &ldquo;Hits right
natural. And you&rsquo;re &rsquo;most what mought be said
to be in the pirates&rsquo; an&rsquo; wreckers&rsquo; haunts, too.
Not fur away to what they call Black Caesar&rsquo;s
Creek&mdash;they do say that old pirate was a terror.
An&rsquo; all around&mdash;just beyond, is a regular ships&rsquo;
graveyard&mdash;why you kin right near see ribs
and rudder posts, an&rsquo; bits of keel sticking up,
from here. Not quite, but you near-&rsquo;bout kin
see &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;s just away yonder.&rdquo; He gestured
in the general direction of the lower neck
of Biscayne Bay and the Fowney Rocks light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; said Nicky, before Cliff could warn
him again, &ldquo;is that called Crocodile Key?&rdquo; He
indicated the land at their bow.</p>
<p>Nelse started. He almost dropped his pipe.
Then he straightened. Nicky felt eyes that were
suddenly very piercing, boring at him in the
deepening twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come you ast that?&rdquo; demanded Nelse.</p>
<p>Mr. Neale took things in hand before Nicky
could commit himself further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told them there was such a place
nearby, and I had a notion I&rsquo;d try for a croc&rsquo;
if that is so,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Nelse sat up straight and bent forward while
Pomp&rsquo; in his boat subdued a cackle of laughter
and became very serious, an expression that
made his plump face look ludicrously like a
monkey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; ordered Nelse, sharply, &ldquo;for your
own sakes, keep away f&rsquo;om that place yonder&mdash;&rsquo;specially
at nights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Tom, his voice beginning to get
weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because!&rdquo; declared Nelse, &ldquo;they say that
Black Caesar buried some treasure there one
time. And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more reason&mdash;&rdquo; began Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Nelse silenced him with a curt shake of the
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; he took up his talk, &ldquo;Black Caesar
was the meanest and most brutal pirate that
ever lived! They say, if anybody comes to try
to git his treasure, him and his mates appears&mdash;ghos&rsquo;s,
you know! An&rsquo; woe betide them what
they puts their spell on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam had retired, shuddering and groaning,
to the cabin. Pomp&rsquo; began to look over his
shoulder. &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; Nelse,&rdquo; he quavered, &ldquo;come
on, suh&mdash;don&rsquo; talk no moah &rsquo;bout dat! Le&rsquo;s git
on home&mdash;please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelse nodded. &ldquo;You see, I reckon,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Ever&rsquo;body here-&rsquo;bouts believes hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen the pirates&mdash;are they
real or spooks?&rdquo; asked Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; home, late, one night, bein&rsquo; becalmed
in a sail boat&mdash;I see &rsquo;em. Loading
chests o&rsquo; treasure in the moonlight! Bet you
I never want to see &rsquo;em no more! No, suh!&rdquo;
Pomp&rsquo; gasped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Nelse to his servant&rsquo;s tale,
&ldquo;next day after Pomp&rsquo; told me&mdash;he was near-&rsquo;bout
scared out o&rsquo; his clo&rsquo;es&mdash;I took me a
rifle an&rsquo; went onto that land &rsquo;side o&rsquo; the inlet,
there&mdash;where you see that bit o&rsquo; rock under the
mangrove&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;they had been some man
there, it looked like he had been tryin&rsquo; to locate
somethin&rsquo; and started to dig for it&mdash;but&mdash;he&mdash;won&rsquo;t&mdash;never&mdash;dig&mdash;no
mo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three chums shuddered in spite of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; asked Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond hurtin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; said Nelse solemnly. He
refused an invitation to stay for supper, complied
with Pomp&rsquo;s pleading and tumbled into
his boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you,&rdquo; he said in farewell, &ldquo;an&rsquo; had
any idea o&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; for what I reckon may be
hid on that strip o&rsquo; land&mdash;I&rsquo;d up sail an&rsquo; away
quick&rsquo;s the wind &rsquo;ud take me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar!&rdquo; mumbled Sam in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whatever you do,&rdquo; called Nelse, &ldquo;if
there is any spooks&mdash;doan&rsquo; try for to bother
&rsquo;em none&mdash;they&rsquo;s more to them ha&rsquo;nts&mdash;&rdquo; his
word for ghosts &ldquo;&mdash;than most folks knows, I
reckon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t get me there,&rdquo; declared
Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The slow, idle evening gave them plenty of
time to recount their feelings and to argue to
and fro about ghosts, spooks, ha&rsquo;nts, and buccaneers&rsquo;
apparitions in particular. Sam, refusing
to come forth even to cook supper, took no
part. He crouched in a corner, muttering some
charm or spell of protection taught him by
Ma&rsquo;am Sib, no doubt, till Cliff called, &ldquo;Oh, Sam&mdash;shut
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that talks doesn&rsquo;t scare me,&rdquo; Nicky declared,
&ldquo;nor Sam, either, even with his witch-charms.
I&rsquo;d sort of like to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very second he had his wish!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">SAM SHOWS HIS TRUE COLORS</span></span></h2>
<p>On shore a queer light appeared. It was
queer in more ways than one. It was of a
peculiar green, an uncanny green; it was not
the light of a lantern, shining all around; it
seemed like a small window lighted up with an
uncanny glow&mdash;and it was where no window
could be. The light seemed to be moving, very
slowly, when Cliff discovered it and without a
word directed his comrades&rsquo; attention toward
it.</p>
<p>While they stared, the light came slowly
closer to the shore&mdash;and yet it did not seem to
be carried&mdash;it glided along almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Tom, with a nervous clutch on Mr. Neale&rsquo;s
arm, indicated the open water of the Sound.
Across it a boat was moving, slowly, steadily,
toward them.</p>
<p>Yet, although it came steadily along and they
could see the men as dim, ghostly shapes, the
oars made no sound as the forms in the boat
plied them&mdash;bend! straighten!&mdash;bend! straighten!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The light had stopped moving and seemed
to hang, a queer window of illumination, above
the water on which its gleam was reflected
faintly. The boat came toward them. In its
bow a figure stood&mdash;and what a figure! In the
dim star-gleam it seemed gigantic. Not a sound
accompanied the slow progress of the strange
craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got something in his hand!&rdquo; gasped
Nicky.</p>
<p>The man, as the boat came to within thirty
feet of the sloop, raised his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sword&mdash;&rdquo; whispered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! A cutlass!&rdquo; Cliff breathed.</p>
<p>The ghostly figure, its head tied up in some
sort of cloth, its face a white blur under the
white head covering, made a menacing gesture,
as of one thrusting at them, with the implement
in his hand.</p>
<p>Then he lifted the cutlass and with it pointed
away toward the passage between the mangroves
where they had come into the Sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, or you will suffer!&rdquo; his gestures
seemed to say.</p>
<p>His boat, still without a sound, like a wraith
on the water, swung away toward the light.</p>
<p>Hardly breathing, the chums watched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boat, ahoy!&rdquo; called Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>There was no response. Like a craft of
dreams the boat moved off and they saw it progress
steadily to shore.</p>
<p>The light, green and gruesome, seemed to
grow larger and brighter, and it turned slightly
so that it lighted up the shelving bit of sand
at the mouth of the inlet.</p>
<p>Onto this small beach, with no sound that
could be heard, the boat-load of wraith-like
figures debarked.</p>
<p>They seemed to be all white, like ghosts, in
sheets or some sort of glimmeringly pale garments.
They bent toward the boat in the glow
that made them seem like luminous, greenish
shapes of evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; breathed Tom, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re lifting a
chest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were! A chest or box of treasure was
being shifted to the sand. Several others followed,
still without answer to Mr. Neale&rsquo;s repeated
hail.</p>
<p>Sam, who had refused to leave his retreat in
the stuffy cabin, began to whimper. Through a
port-hole, at their captain&rsquo;s hail, he had stolen
one glance. It was enough!</p>
<p>Tom, too, was demoralized; but he dared not
speak; only by the shaking of his hand on
Nicky&rsquo;s arm did his terror show.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>On shore there seemed to be a ghostly argument&mdash;suddenly,
in the greenish glow, knives
flashed out, were lifted, were plunged into action!
Yet no sound of a fight came across the
water.</p>
<p>Figures dropped! Forms strove, hand in
hand, knives upraised and driven downward!</p>
<p>And at one side, a little above the rest, and
sharply silhouetted as a tall form in white,
stood the one who must be the leader, his cutlass
held ready, but making no move.</p>
<p>And then, all but one of the contending silent
figures was down! The survivor of the battle
turned and rushed toward his chief&mdash;the glow
disappeared and the silence, the darkness,
closed down more eerily than ever!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they&mdash;what are they doing?&rdquo;
gasped Nicky.</p>
<p>Mr. Neale was drawing in on the line that
secured the dinghy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>For once there were no volunteers for the
investigation!</p>
<p>Tom begged his chief not to go, but Mr.
Neale, with a word of encouragement, assuring
them that he felt that the strange scene had
more than supernatural explanation, rowed
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The wait seemed interminable. They heard
his oars squeal in the rowlocks, saw the dinghy
reach the shore and lose way; then there was
a silence and an absence of movement. They
could not make out what Mr. Neale was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d gone along, now,&rdquo; Nicky said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have gone, too&mdash;he might need
help.&rdquo; Cliff seconded his chum&rsquo;s tardy return
of courage.</p>
<p>But the dinghy was returning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said when he had
transferred himself to the cockpit, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
find a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t find&mdash;no boat&mdash;nothing?&rdquo; quavered
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not much sleep that night and
they were all glad to see the sky begin to turn
gray, then lighter, in the East, as dawn came.</p>
<p>Sam came out sullenly to prepare breakfast.
Their supplies were very low for they had laid
in only a small store, to keep up their pretence
of cruising among islands where food was plentiful.
At several points of the shore they had
secured yams, corn flour and other necessities,
but the meal, with a lean larder and a morose,
intimidated cook, yielded little zest or nourishment
for even such good appetites as the Mystery
Boys usually possessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to suggest that you fellows go
ashore,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set you on the
beach&mdash;and be careful about snakes! Then I&rsquo;ll
take the dinghy and go around the point to see
that chap we met last night. There is more
behind this than we see just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think?&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a good deal,&rdquo; the captain replied,
&ldquo;but ghosts are the very last explanation I will
accept!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put Nicky and Cliff on the bank of the
inlet, noting that by daylight the sand and undergrowth
was trampled and muddied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ghosts did all this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There
is a human agency at work and I want to find
out why all this trouble was taken&mdash;to scare
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the sloop, ordered Sam to
pull himself together, and took Tom aboard the
dinghy. When he landed the third of the comrades
Mr. Neale, repeating his warning about
snakes, bade them reconnoiter and find all the
signs they could, against his return. Then he
rowed off toward the point around which Nelse
had said he had a plantation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny Nelse didn&rsquo;t come back this morning,&rdquo;
Cliff observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is in the scheme&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;to
scare us,&rdquo; Nicky mused. &ldquo;Remember how
anxious he was at first, till we said why we
are here&mdash;and then how emphatic he was about
danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did. As they looked about there were
plenty of signs to show that human agencies
and not ghosts had produced the strange scene
the night before.</p>
<p>Not only was the ground trampled, but on
one mangrove root that bent upward and
curved into a sort of prong, they discovered a
strip of cloth that looked like part of a bed
sheet.</p>
<p>But there was no sign of the chests of treasure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing!&rdquo; Nicky declared. His
chums agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom suddenly, pointing
toward the sloop, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s Sam doing? Look&mdash;he&rsquo;s
hoisting the mainsail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam was doing exactly that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy&mdash;Sam!&rdquo; hailed Nicky through cupped
hands.</p>
<p>Sam did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam! Sam!&rdquo; shouted all three. They saw
the colored man turn and look toward them.
Then he picked up a small megaphone that was
part of the boat&rsquo;s equipment and roared at
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away from here, sars! Yes, sar!
Going from here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been scared almost crazy!&rdquo; declared
Cliff, &ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t go away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;And leave us&mdash;and Mr. Neale!&rdquo; cried
Tom.</p>
<p>Nicky began kicking off his shoes. As he
doffed coat and cap, his chums followed his example.
Together they plunged into the water
and swam lustily toward the <i>Treasure Belle</i>.</p>
<p>It was a race against Sam&rsquo;s swift movements.</p>
<p>The sail was up. The anchor came in with a
groan of its chain. Cliff, a few strokes in the
lead, redoubled his efforts.</p>
<p>The <i>Treasure Belle</i> began to move through
the water, taking a puff of wind in the early
morning gusts.</p>
<p>Nicky and Cliff desisted from their effort.
Tom, desperate, seemed fairly to race toward
the stem of the moving slope&mdash;but her pace accelerated.
She stood away toward the neck
through which she would apparently head out
toward Biscayne Bay and the open water.</p>
<p>From the stern Sam waved a hand in farewell!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">ONE MYSTERY IS SOLVED</span></span></h2>
<p>Swimming dejectedly back to their small bit
of beach the chums took off their soaked clothes
and hung them in the sun to dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are!&rdquo; observed Nicky ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are!&rdquo; mimicked Cliff. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you like it? I thought you were fond of mystery
and adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I am or not, I&rsquo;m getting it!&rdquo; Nicky
admitted. &ldquo;But this was more than I bargained
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Cliff grinned at them. &ldquo;You two are&mdash;sort
of&mdash;arm-chair adventurers. You like to
have the thrills without the hardships. Just
look at us!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t be
deeper in adventure if we tried to dig our way
in! Right in the midst of treasure-land!
Stranded and deserted on the edge of an awful
swamp&mdash;isn&rsquo;t the Big Cypress Swamp north of
us? Surely it is! Without food! Drenched
and helpless. What more could you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are aiming at,&rdquo; Nicky
grinned back. &ldquo;We must take it as it comes
and make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re
not so badly off. Mr. Neale will come rowing
along in the dinghy and then we&rsquo;ll all crowd in
and be rescued&mdash;what a story we&rsquo;ll have to tell
our grandchildren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were compelled to laugh at his tone
and his ludicrous words. It made them all feel
better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Neale had reached Nelse&rsquo;s
place and been greeted by Pomp&rsquo; who assured
him that he was welcome to wait until Mars&rsquo;
Nelse came back with his canoe&mdash;having gone
&ldquo;off yonder,&rdquo; Pomp&rsquo; said with a vague wave of
his hand toward the Sound.</p>
<p>Waiting on the rude little dock, Mr. Neale
caught sight of the <i>Treasure Belle</i> standing
away for an opening into bigger water.</p>
<p>It astonished him and rendered him helpless
to act! He knew that he could not hope to
overtake her with his dinghy, and Pomp&rsquo; assured
him that there was no faster boat within
reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;spect dat black man f&rsquo;om Jamaica done
got de skeer under his wool and run off wif
de white chill&rsquo;un,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone alone,&rdquo; Mr. Neale stated. &ldquo;I
left the boys on the shore by the inlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped in to the dinghy and began to row
down the shore line; it was no time to wait for
Nelse. He must see whether the boys were
where he had left them or if they had managed
to return, by swimming, before Sam got the
boat under headway.</p>
<p>He was forced to conclude that they were
either voluntarily going with Sam or that they
were under some compulsion on the sloop.</p>
<p>Certainly they were not on the shore!</p>
<p>He beached the dinghy and sat in it, considering.
Where were his charges? Why had
they let Sam get away if they had reached the
sloop?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the chums were having
an adventure they had not counted on.</p>
<p>Hardly had they decided to wait for their
chief when a thought had struck Nicky. &ldquo;If we
were detectives, now,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;we could find
out what all this mystery is concealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have nothing better to do,&rdquo; Tom
suggested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try our hand at &lsquo;detecting!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;First off, that
boat, last night, didn&rsquo;t come back into the
Sound. And there&rsquo;s signs enough that real
people were here. Where did they go? Where
did they take the boat? And what did they do
with the chests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy!&rdquo; Nicky declared. &ldquo;They went
up this little river, and they either put the
chests back in their own boat or in another one,
that had that funny light on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did they go, then,&rdquo; demanded
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the inlet, I said,&rdquo; Nicky retorted. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t get through the mangroves and the tangle
of brush, but a boat&mdash;or boats&mdash;could go up as
far as that bend yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s beyond the bend,&rdquo; reflected
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;while our clothes dry!&rdquo; Nicky
urged, slipping into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;wait!&rdquo; called Cliff. &ldquo;Look out for
water snakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or&mdash;crocodiles!&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; laughed Nicky, turning and swimming
slowly up the inlet.</p>
<p>They watched him anxiously. He waved an
arm reassuringly and in a hundred easy strokes
was at the point where the inlet turned out of
their sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go around there by yourself!&rdquo; called
Cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same, around the bend,&rdquo; Nicky
said as he trod water for an instant. Then he
swam out of their sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky!&rdquo; called Tom anxiously.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, then a faint
answer came. The place seemed suddenly to be
spooky and queer.</p>
<p>Of a sudden there was a sharp, low cry, and
then silence.</p>
<p>Tom and Cliff looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky!&rdquo; shrilled Tom.</p>
<p>They strained their ears.</p>
<p>There was no answer!</p>
<p>With one accord, never pausing to think of
personal danger, knowing that Nicky was not
the sort to play a joke, that if he failed to answer
their hail he must be in peril, they slipped
into the water and used their utmost effort to
reach the bend.</p>
<p>Hardly had they left the tiny beach when a
Seminole Indian, with an almost expressionless
face, emerged from a clump of heavy bushes
through which he had been calmly, stolidly observing
them for a half hour.</p>
<p>That was why, when Mr. Neale arrived ten
minutes later, no clothes hung in the sun to furnish
a clue to the presence of the boys.</p>
<p>As the two chums reached the bend and could
see around it they suspended their strokes and
stared!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Nicky was not in danger at all!</p>
<p>But he was evidently too stupefied by what
he was regarding to have heard their call; or,
perhaps the dense growth had dulled the sound.
At any rate, they paddled hastily forward until
they could climb out beside their comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo; demanded Cliff,
his anxiety shifting to a natural anger at the
fright Nicky had given them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Golly! I guess I was too surprised to
hear you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky lifted an arm and waved it at the
scene before them.</p>
<p>On the shore a light canoe of cedar, hollowed
out of the virgin wood as the Seminoles create
their water craft, lay upturned.</p>
<p>Beyond that there was a spot cleared in the
heavy brush growth, and there were piled cases
and crates, perhaps fifty of them!</p>
<p>It did not require the stenciled black letters
at the visible ends of certain cases to indicate
the truth to the chums. An old ship&rsquo;s lantern
of the sort used at the starboard and port sides,
with a screen of green glass over its front indicated
where the previous night&rsquo;s uncanny
glow had come from. But the cases themselves
told more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum runners!&rdquo; gasped Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have guessed,&rdquo; Cliff said.
&ldquo;Nelse is one of them. That&rsquo;s why he tried
to scare us away. This is a nest of them. I
suppose they can run up from the islands&mdash;especially
Cuba&mdash;get their large boat hidden
from the Government patrol on some dark
night, in among the keys, and then ferry the
cases over here in smaller boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good does that do them?&rdquo; Tom
wondered. &ldquo;How do they get the cases to
market?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the Seminole Indians, or maybe half-breeds,
work with them. It must be the Seminoles
because they know the waterways in the
Big Cypress Swamp and the Everglades, and
I don&rsquo;t think many white men do&mdash;they
didn&rsquo;t up to recently, anyhow, according to a
book on exploration I read.&rdquo; Nicky made the
statement excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we never find any treasure,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;there must be a big reward for breaking
up trade like this. It&rsquo;s wicked. It&rsquo;s against
the law and the Constitution, and even if there
wasn&rsquo;t any reward we will have to try some
way to get word to the Government boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight stir in the grass and scrub
behind and to the left of them.</p>
<p>When, with one accord, they turned, a Seminole
Indian faced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Nicky, a little uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The man made no immediate reply. Instead,
he lifted an arm and beckoned, then pointed
toward a narrow trail beyond the clearing.</p>
<p>Nicky looked at Cliff, and both consulted
Tom with their eyes. They all read a common
intention; they would swing about and rush to
the inlet and swim back to the shore.</p>
<p>The Indian divined their purpose; with a
snakelike movement he stepped to a point preventing
the move. His hand touched something
bright and sinister at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se-lof-ka-chop-kaw!&rdquo; he said, Seminole dialect
for &ldquo;My knife is long!&rdquo; He partly unsheathed
the weapon.</p>
<p>Silently the chums took the trail, their captor
following close.</p>
<p>And two hundred yards away Mr. Neale sat
by the shore, wondering!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">MODERN PIRATES</span></span></h2>
<p>Picking up the bundles of their clothes, the
Seminole herded the chums along the trail; its
limestone-coral hurt their tender, bare feet
while they had hard work to avoid the deep,
searing gashes which saw grass makes.</p>
<p>They came after a few minutes to a small
open glade, almost bare of soil; here the Indian
made a sharp, guttural sound. They turned.</p>
<p>Gesturing to them to sit, he said &ldquo;A-pok-es-chay,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;All sit down!&rdquo; They read the gesture
but not the words. However, because of their
condition they preferred to stand. After he
tossed their clothes to the ground the Indian
signed for them to spread the garments to dry
again and then, turning, he walked swiftly out
of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a nice fix,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;What will
Mr. Neale do when he sees the sloop gone and
doesn&rsquo;t find us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will think Sam has made off with us&mdash;or
that Tom has been so scared that he helped
Sam,&rdquo; Nicky declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>As a point of truth, Mr. Neale at almost that
moment gave up his waiting vigil, and with dejected
shoulders bent to the oars for a long,
grilling pull across the Sound. His purpose
was to try to reach some revenue guards or
others who could help him to overtake the
<i>Treasure Belle</i>.</p>
<p>They were not to meet their chief again for
some time!</p>
<p>They dressed when their clothes were dried.
The first effort they made to retrace the way
down the trail was met by the appearance of
the Seminole; he was on guard if not always
visible.</p>
<p>Seated, dejectedly idle, the chums waited. A
brief exploration by Cliff toward the side of the
trail they had not traversed yielded no way of
escape. It ended at another water path, this
one going off from what might be a transfer
and landing dock, off toward the North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the Indians come with their
own canoes,&rdquo; Cliff told his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do they take the liquor?&rdquo; Nicky
wondered. &ldquo;Up at the north of the Everglades
there isn&rsquo;t anything much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the place to load trucks, I suppose,&rdquo;
Cliff surmised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The afternoon dragged. They were not fed
and no offer was made by the Seminole to converse.
He seemed not to understand Nicky&rsquo;s
attempt to address him in English, but shook
his head, waved the youth back and touched his
belt significantly.</p>
<p>Night came and still they were in their uncomfortably
hard position, and growing very
hungry indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he means to starve us, why I&rsquo;m going to
make a break as soon as it gets pitchy dark,&rdquo;
Nicky whispered.</p>
<p>But as soon as it got pitchy dark there came
a peculiar call from the dock where Indians
were supposed to arrive, and the young adventurers
soon found themselves the center of a
small group of the Indians, one about their own
age, but not at all approachable. With the
green-glassed ship&rsquo;s lantern to show them, their
captor made an explanation in his guttural dialect
and then left the younger member of the
party on watch while, with the others, began
transferring the cases from the further end of
the trail to the dock, and thence, the chums inferred,
to canoes.</p>
<p>Cliff tried to establish conversation with
their young guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;No-chit-pay-lon-es-chay!&rdquo; he said. They did
not comprehend that he ordered them to lie
down and sleep, and kept eagerly arguing that
they were hungry, pointing to their open
mouths, in the dim light, and rubbing their
stomachs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-toke-kee-aw-mun-chee!&rdquo; he said, holding
out his hand, palm up. He meant, &ldquo;Give me
money,&rdquo; but they had none and so the negotiations
were suspended.</p>
<p>Finally, when, as Nicky declared, their backbones
were shaking hands with their stomachs,
a new voice was heard on the trail.</p>
<p>Preceded by their earlier captor, bearing the
lantern, whose queer light he threw full in the
chums&rsquo; faces, there came a squatty, burly, ape-like
white man, with a jutting jaw, sharp, mean
eyes, but with a quirk of a smile at one side of
his twisted mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he said, in a deep rumble, &ldquo;thought
you cleared out this morning. Saw the craft up
anchor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a gesture that sent the Indian
away; the lantern, set down as he left, gave the
scene a weird green light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my lads,&rdquo; began the man, &ldquo;how&rsquo;d you
come to stay here, when the sloop sailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky told him about their colored man and
his terror of the ghostly boat the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho!&rdquo; laughed their new acquaintance.
&ldquo;Scared him, did it? We aimed to scare the
whole passel of you&mdash;we went to enough
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you want to scare us?&rdquo; demanded
Nicky eagerly.</p>
<p>The other did not answer. He seemed to be
deep in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to feed us?&rdquo; demanded
Tom, more practically. Fearful though he
might be in face of the unknown, he was no
coward when face to face with a situation he
could understand. And hunger was such a situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No eats! Hum&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; The man rubbed
a stubby, brownish beard, reflectively. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t starve you&mdash;we aimed to drive you away,
but that didn&rsquo;t work&mdash;still, no use to starve you
till we know all we want to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sign, as if he had decided on his
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, back down the trail,&rdquo; he ordered.
Nicky, Tom and Cliff lost no time in complying.</p>
<p>Following, with the light, he directed them
to the inlet where most of the cases were now
being carried away. He spoke rapidly to the
Seminole who seemed to be the leader of the
Indian faction, gave him some coins, and then
ordered the three chums into his boat&mdash;the
same one, for all they knew, which they had
seen the night before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I see how they got away after scaring
us,&rdquo; whispered Tom as the crew of four
stoutly-built white men used their oars as paddles,
working the boat further along the inlet
until they came to a point where they made
still another turn and went down another narrow
stream toward the Sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just &lsquo;ring-around-a-rosy,&rsquo;&rdquo; Cliff declared.
&ldquo;That makes the spot those three trees are on
an island&mdash;a key&mdash;after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll get no chance at any treasure,
there,&rdquo; said Nicky dejectedly.</p>
<p>Apparently the nearest of the crew thought
this was important enough to call to the attention
of his captain. He turned and repeated
Nicky&rsquo;s words, with a guffaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure, hey?&rdquo; cried the bearded white
man. &ldquo;Who told you there was treasure there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky stammered, hesitated, then
decided that it could make no difference anyway
whether he told it all or not&mdash;with Mr.
Neale unaccounted for, with Sam and his sloop
gone, with their own selves captive, what
chance had they for treasure? They&rsquo;d be lucky,
he thought, to be set ashore, marooned like old-time
sailors&mdash;and spared a worse fate!</p>
<p>He told of finding the old can on the islet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hum-m-m!&rdquo; mused the man, clearing his
throat. &ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t find a treasure&mdash;but,
anyhow, you&rsquo;ll get a square meal&mdash;then,
we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking us?&rdquo; demanded Nicky,
once more brave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to our floating palace. Maybe&mdash;who
knows&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;ll turn out to be a treasure
hunt, after all. In that case the boys&rsquo;ll welcome
it for a change from hi-jacking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi&mdash;hi&mdash;&rdquo; Cliff gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi&mdash;jacking, he said,&rdquo; Tom explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Cliff shivered, &ldquo;and that makes
it worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than being in the hands of rum-runners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse! I&rsquo;d say so! Hi-jackers are pirates
if ever anybody was. The rum-runners bring
contraband, and illegal liquor, into the States
against the law. But the hi-jackers are men
who hold up their boats and trucks and steal
from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard about them,&rdquo; said Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cliff under his breath as their
boat scudded over the waters of the Sound
toward a small island near the upper end, &ldquo;well,
it would be bad enough to be caught by people
who break the law; but the ones who prey on
them are about the roughest and toughest
people in the world. They are modern pirates
and no mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nicky, shrugging his shoulders,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get through somehow, and anyway&mdash;we
eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the island they found a trim, beautifully
built, low, rakish craft. She was a power
boat, about sixty feet long&mdash;a little more, perhaps.
She lay low in the water and was of
such a dull color that she could scarcely be seen
in the dark.</p>
<p>They touched her side at a hanging ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up you go!&rdquo; said the man, under his breath.
Then, to someone at the rail, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s three
young recroots, Don Ortiga!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky gulped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
whispered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ortiga&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky returned, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the name
of the man who owned that other speed boat,
back in Jamaica! Now&mdash;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">THE MYSTERY BOYS DECIDE</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wonder?&rdquo; asked Tom, when
the chums were herded into the small forecastle
in the bow, vacant at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who owned that boat, back in Jamaica&mdash;the
<i>El Libertad</i>&mdash;was named Senor Ortiga,&rdquo;
Nicky answered. &ldquo;I wonder if this one
is the same fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t the <i>Libertad</i>,&rdquo; Tom objected.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bigger boat and it isn&rsquo;t white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that fellow called this man &lsquo;Don&rsquo; and
not &lsquo;Senor,&rsquo;&rdquo; Cliff added. &ldquo;They may be relatives.
Mr. Neale saw the man in Jamaica&mdash;he
would know. I wonder where he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he expressed this wondering about their
chief, the latter was holding a conference with
a Government Revenue Officer in the tiny cabin
of a very swift little revenue cutter which was
cruising among the reefs and keys, in search
of the very hi-jackers and rum-runners among
whom the chums were quartered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The revenue cutter was on patrol duty, but
so far its quarry had, by virtue of a system of
signals from allies on shore, eluded capture;
with its gray hull, its absence of lights, its quiet
and speedy engines, the light-draught craft had
been able to slip into hiding while its cargo
was transferred to shore, whence the Indians
in the extensive gang would convey it in their
canoes to a northern point in Florida where
trucks could receive the cases of illicit liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish there was some way for us to capture
these fellows,&rdquo; said Tom. Now that he
knew that there was nothing ghostly or unnatural
about the band, he was his usual, cool,
calm self. Nicky and Cliff echoed his wish, in
low tones. But they had no time for speculation
or planning. The ape-like man appeared
in the forecastle companionway and beckoned
abruptly.</p>
<p>They followed him along a narrow deck to
the dark cabin and went in. After passing
through heavy sacking, double-thick, which
served to block the passage of the least rays
of light to the outer world, they found themselves
in a long, quite roomy cabin, with a small
electric dome light giving enough light to show
the heavy black curtains tightly fastened over
the circular ports, or windows. Well furnished
with several easy chairs of rattan, with bunks
that folded into the woodwork of the side walls
and left a cushioned seat for use when they
were not open, and with a veritable arsenal of
automatic revolvers, rifles and knives of many
shapes on the shelves of a cupboard at one
end, the cabin looked both comfortable and dangerous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>A tall, slender man was replacing some
weapon in the cupboard.</p>
<p>He turned as the chums entered; their guide
stood blocking the doorway behind them.</p>
<p>The occupant of the cabin was of a Spanish
type, with dark skin and sharp, black eyes, as
black as his smoothly brushed hair. His movements
were abrupt and nervous and his voice,
when he spoke was curt and rather high in
pitch, though kept at a low level of volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit!&rdquo; said the tall man, motioning toward
the wall benches; the chums obeyed while the
tall one dropped into a rattan chair and regarded
them steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came here to get buried treasure,&rdquo; said
the man in the chair. &ldquo;Who told you there was
treasure here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky became the spokesman and related the
story; he told how they had been cruising toward
the Ten Thousand Island Archipelago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For why?&rdquo; demanded their inquisitor
sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Nicky was about to open his lips; his eye
caught a gesture of Tom&rsquo;s. While leaning forward,
chin on hand, elbow on knee, as if listening
alertly, Tom was scratching his left ear absently.
Cliff was folding his arms.</p>
<p>It was the secret sign-manual of their order&mdash;the
Mystery Boys&mdash;by which Tom signified
a call for a communication by gesture and Cliff,
by folding his arms, indicated his agreement.
Nicky folded his arms at the same instant, and
then saw Tom grasp his coat lapel in his left
hand.</p>
<p>That sign meant the third section of their
secret oath&mdash;&ldquo;Telling all, I tell nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky clasped his hands on his knees, a sign
that he agreed.</p>
<p>It all took place without apparent meaning
and in a very brief time so that, although he
made a sign of impatience, the tall man and his
companion, leaning against the wall by the companionway,
seemed to discern no hidden meaning
in Nicky&rsquo;s delayed answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Answer! Why were you among the
islands?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was trying to figure out why we were
there,&rdquo; Nicky replied, a candid look on his face.
&ldquo;You see, we had the &lsquo;flu&rsquo; back at our school
and we went to Jamaica to join this boy&rsquo;s
father&mdash;&rdquo; he made a gesture toward Cliff and
continued. &ldquo;A young fellow was helping Cliff&rsquo;s
father collect old relics of the Indians and he
brought us up to those islands in a sloop with
a colored pilot&mdash;just for a lark on our part.
I think he meant to get a canoe and maybe take
us with him up the Harney River to the edge
of the Everglades&mdash;or into them, to collect some
things from the Seminoles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a part of Mr. Neale&rsquo;s plan, if they
did not find the treasure, or, perhaps, even if
they did; so Nicky told the truth, though not
all of it. Cliff unclasped his hands as if signifying
that Nicky had done well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si&mdash;yes, that is reasonable,&rdquo; commented the
tall man. &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom made no gesture, which Nicky correctly
judged to mean that as long as he had told the
man by the companionway about the can and
the parchment he might as well repeat the
story.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that agree, Tew, with what they told
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the name, Tew, Nicky started a little. In
the early days of piracy, as his studies had told
him, one of the most notorious of the old sea
barons, Thomas Tew, had made piratical history;
could this man be a descendant? Could
he be filled with the same daring and ferocity?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;It agrees, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; responded Tew. Don Ortiga
leaned back, tapping the arm of his chair
nervously while he thought.</p>
<p>The chums sat in silence, their three pairs of
arms folded in sign that they were still in secret
communion and waiting. After a long silence
during which he considered them shrewdly, the
Spaniard spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it! Do you, Tew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds &lsquo;fishy&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; answered the apelike
fellow. &ldquo;First of all, them three trees on that
little key ain&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n fifty years old. And my
folks, and Nelse&rsquo;s folks, has lived about these
waters for more time&rsquo;n that and there ain&rsquo;t
been no treasure buried that I ever heard of&mdash;not
in the last fifty years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! Again, Tew,&rdquo; the Don ignored his
young captives in the intentness of some point
he was trying to make, &ldquo;again, a tin can would
have rusted away and crumbled, or sank into
the soil. You know that most of those islets
are not really built up from the coral foundation.
They are mostly thickly matted vegetation,
roots and so on, with a thin covering of soil;
if you stamp hard on many of them you can
shake them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; agreed Tew. &ldquo;Besides, from
what these fellows claim, there was a funny
light and something knocked on their boat&mdash;if
you was to ask my opinion, cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;d say I
think these lubbers is makin&rsquo; it up out o&rsquo; the
whole cloth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not!&rdquo; defended Nicky sharply.</p>
<p>Don Ortiga regarded him steadily for a while,
then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the message on the paper?&rdquo; he
asked suddenly.</p>
<p>There was no help for it. All three chums
realized that. If Nicky hesitated their captors
would be certain that he was inventing a message.
Then there was no telling what might happen
to them! The men who had them as captives
were hi-jackers, the lowest form of seafaring
marauders. One of them had a name indicating
descent from the old pirate stock. The
truth&mdash;and the truth quickly&mdash;seemed to be the
only course open to Nicky.</p>
<p>His glance toward his friends showed them
with both hands in coat pockets&mdash;&ldquo;Tell the
truth!&rdquo; that meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the message,&rdquo; Nicky declared without
delay, all that swift querying and decision
having occupied only the time it took for him
to understand the question, a split second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the message,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;&lsquo;Treasure
found long ago. Dig under tallest of three
trees on Crocodile Key for more.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tew rushed close to his captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crocodile Key!&rdquo; he almost shouted; then he
lowered his voice. &ldquo;Nobody knew that name but
us&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped, his face working with what
the chums took to be anger and surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;somebody did!&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n&mdash;your brother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky exchanged glances with his comrades.
In their eyes he read the same thought that
was in his mind. They had given these men
some clue that proved to them that the message
was a false lead and&mdash;more&mdash;had told
them who prepared it! Don Ortiga had a
brother. That must be the Senor Ortiga&mdash;or
might be, Nicky thought. If the message was
a false lead, then it had been deliberately placed
where they found it, to mislead them. Yes,
and not only that, but deliberate methods of
making it seem supernaturally discovered had
been used&mdash;the light and the raps on the hull
of their sloop!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Don Ortiga was saying, &ldquo;my brother&mdash;Rodriguez&mdash;these
boys say they were in Jamaica&mdash;that
is where he gets the rum he brings
to the keys in <i>El Libertad</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole mystery was beginning to become
as clear to the chums as it seemed to their captors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows say they left Jamaica to go
to the archipelago,&rdquo; Tew took up the reasoning.
&ldquo;For pleasure? For relics? My eye!
No! They knowed somewhat about a treasure&mdash;and
so did your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky cried incautiously in
his excitement, and then stopped, too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a treasure!&rdquo; Tew exulted, and
his eyes took on a bright avaricious glitter.
&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n, these boys know somewhat about a
treasure on them islands. Recall? Ships has
been wrecked there&mdash;in the old days there was
a story about a Spanish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; broke in the Don, bending forward,
making jerky, excited movements of his fingers
and with snapping eyes. &ldquo;A ship laden with
gold bars! It was never discovered&mdash;the gold!
The ship broke up, and parts of it were picked
up in the Gulf of Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of themselves, at this verification of
the old map and message of Captain Kidd, the
chums took fire from their companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Ortiga must have knowed about it&mdash;or
learned that these lads did,&rdquo; Tew went on,
never questioning the chums, taking it for
granted that his logic was sound. &ldquo;He must
of saw them sail in a slow sloop&mdash;he had
a fast cruiser. He beat them to the islands and
took a chance he could send them somewhere
else while he searched. He picked our place&mdash;But
why? They&rsquo;d discover us. He&rsquo;d know
that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Don Ortiga sprang from his chair; his hands
were clenched, his eyes sparkled with an angry
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent them here because he has a grudge
for us ever since we bought a faster boat and
a bigger one and took his trade away from
him!&rdquo; he cried in a fury, but remembering to
keep his tones fairly low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Tew, after a moment, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
how I tote it up! We can get more out of a
chest of treasure than we can from a hold full
of rum, and with no fightin&rsquo;. These lads must
know where the gold is&mdash;we don&rsquo;t! So we can
use them! At the same time we can get revenge
on your brother for sendin&rsquo; them where they
might of found out about our racket and told
the revenue men&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums saw what was coming; their arms
were folded again and they were waiting, trembling
a little with the excitement. What decision
must they make? What decision could they
make? Was there any way out? They could
see none!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it up to &rsquo;em!&rdquo; urged Tew. &ldquo;Will you
&lsquo;throw in&rsquo; with us, takin&rsquo; a small share, or will
we put them in the hold till we get what they
know&mdash;we have ways!&rdquo; he added with a meaning
glare, &ldquo;and when we get the treasure we&rsquo;ll&mdash;well,
whatever you decide, Cap&rsquo;n&mdash;I know
you can think up some pretty interestin&rsquo; ways
to get rid of folks we don&rsquo;t need&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Nicky made a gesture; his right hand rubbed
his nose, from his eye to his lips, as if removing
a smudge; Cliff and Tom answered his sign,
&ldquo;Shall we say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;?&rdquo; by nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your say?&rdquo; demanded Ortiga. &ldquo;Tell
all or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share-and-share-alike!&rdquo; he demanded with
a defiant effort that seemed to please Tew. Don
Ortiga nodded, &ldquo;Share-and-share!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal out our cutlasses an&rsquo; bandanas,&rdquo; said
Nicky with affected ferocity. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re with you
till the last man walks the plank!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">THE CHASE</span></span></h2>
<p>Although Nicky had put a brave face on a
bad situation, all three chums realized how grave
was their danger. Their word had been accepted
without question and they were given
the freedom of the ship, after its crew had been
summoned to the cabin and a vote taken. Only
one member, the engineer, put in a word of dissent
to Don Ortiga&rsquo;s suggestion that they start
at once for the archipelago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that revenue cutter,&rdquo; he reminded
his mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her!&rdquo; said Tew, sneeringly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we got
plenty of ways to show her our heels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky and his fellows wondered what these
ways might be. They were to discover at least
one of them.</p>
<p>They were given a plentiful meal in the cabin;
the hi-jackers fared well, evidently, for the meal
comprised fresh eggs, four apiece, fresh milk,
since none of them cared much for coffee,
white bread, corn pone as a second choice, and
rice pudding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The cook was an affable, smiling colored man
from Miami, the flourishing tourist resort in
Florida, who found his share of illicit gain more
alluring than the wages of an honest chef in a
hotel.</p>
<p>Besides the cook and Don Ortiga and his first
mate, Tew, there were four deck hands who
also rowed the boat with muffled oars and
padded oarlocks, and who helped to load and
unload what they carried; also there was the
engineer and Nelse. The latter, they found out
later, was only aboard for a certain purpose,
not one of the crew.</p>
<p>While they noted the precision machinery for
driving the boat, and saw the novel way in which
the exhaust was deadened by being run through
a large pipe through a sheathed channel in the
hull, into a specially devised muffler which completely
broke up the explosive force of the spent
gases and silenced their noise, the chums marveled
at the pains that had been taken to make
a once innocent pleasure yacht into a craft
suited for breaking its country&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>Nicky reiterated his wish that they could do
something to bring the lawbreakers to justice,
but Tom, again cautious, urged him not even to
think of it just then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Mr. Neale, their chief in the beginning of the
expedition, had overhauled Sam&rsquo;s sloop with
the aid of the revenue cutter&rsquo;s men, had learned
Sam&rsquo;s side of the story, found Sam contrite but
afraid to return, had discovered that the
United States men could take no action against
the Jamaican, and let Sam go his way rejoicing.
The revenue cutter then returned toward
the keys in order to land Mr. Neale at a
base from which he could carry on his search
for the missing boys.</p>
<p>But the cutter did not get there that night.</p>
<p>Nicky, Tom and Cliff stood on the foredeck
of the hi-jackers&rsquo; ship as the anchor was quietly
drawn up and the engines began turning over,
their twin-four cylinders thudding with little
outward noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go!&rdquo; Nicky whispered. &ldquo;Off on our
first piratical cruise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off to be shot,&rdquo; Cliff corrected, &ldquo;if that revenue
cutter they spoke about ever see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t shoot us,&rdquo; Nicky protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;But
they will chase&mdash;and this boat will run. That
means a shot across the bows and more if we
don&rsquo;t &lsquo;heave to&rsquo;&mdash;which this crew won&rsquo;t do if
they can see a chance to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; for, then?&rdquo; demanded
Cliff. His comrades stared at him; for
answer to their unspoken question he pointed
upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Looking toward the tip of the short spar
that served for a signal mast and for the radio
aerial for the small receiving set with which
the cabin was equipped, capable of tuning-in
short wave stations and the Navy broadcasts of
weather, signals, and so forth, they all saw a
small electric bulb glowing finely into the dark
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;switched!&rdquo; gasped Tom.
&ldquo;Now why should they show a light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the law&mdash;&rdquo; began Nicky, but he stopped,
realizing that these men, all of whom were silent
but fierce-looking, obeyed no law as to
lights or other rules of the seaways.</p>
<p>The lookout just forward of their group was
staring toward the horizon as they nosed gently
forward out of a small strait between a key
and a section of the bay shore. He turned and
made some sort of signal with a tiny, blinking
flashlight in his cupped hands.</p>
<p>Instantly the wheel went hard over, the vessel
swung in a long curve and began to
straighten her wake as speed increased on a
straightaway run down the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see her,&rdquo; Nicky whispered, directing his
chum&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boat and she&rsquo;s heading
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Far off across the water there came a dull
report. At the same instant Nelse came on
deck, gazed for a moment, said &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be
better!&rdquo; to Don Ortiga, and walked aft rapidly,
while the captain stood watching him. Nicky
left the group, took the other side of the cabin
and slipped along the deck. To his amazement
Nelse was dropping into a small boat that was
towing. A deckhand pushed a long, slim pole,
with something at its tip, into the small boat.</p>
<p>Nelse lifted the pole which looked like a
rather long fishing pole, and seemed to be stepping
its butt in a place in his forward thwart.</p>
<p>Forward Tom and Cliff watched with straining
eyes, as did the Don. Another vivid, but
distant flash was followed by a dull report and
there came a faint &ldquo;plash-thunk!&rdquo; in the water
far ahead.</p>
<p>At the same moment a sailor loped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All clear, sir,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Don Ortiga turned, lifted a hand. Tom, his
eye cocked aloft, saw that their masthead light
disappeared instantly. He turned to see if Cliff
had noticed it, and then saw what Nicky, at the
stern, had already guessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Nelse&rsquo;s boat was a decoy. His stout pole
once firmly stepped his ty-line was dropped off
the cruiser&rsquo;s stem, and as the masthead light
winked out he, in some fashion&mdash;it was too
dark for Nicky to see how&mdash;completed an electrical
circuit to a small, similar light on his
pole, so that, if the cutter missed the light for
an instant she would pick it up again and yet
it would be the decoy and not the real ship she
would thereafter pursue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will happen to Nelse?&rdquo; Nicky wondered
when he rejoined his friends and gave
them his information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will row into some little inlet, unship his
pole, maybe pull his boat up on shore and hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ortiga furnished the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t they seen us?&rdquo; demanded Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are low and gray and hard to see. It
remains to be learned,&rdquo; the captain replied. He
watched for an interval while their boat with
only her propeller thrash to carry a message of
her direction, held on swiftly.</p>
<p>The ruse had failed. They could see the cutter
holding a course slantwise to their own! They
must have been seen in spite of the camouflaging
color.</p>
<p>Tew was with Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance&mdash;in the channel to port!&rdquo;
he grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then began the most breathless and thrilling
half hour or more that the chums had ever been
through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Swinging sharply on her heel, so to speak,
their lithe greyhound doubled back into a narrow
lip between two clumps of cocoanut or mangrove,
it was too dark to see which they were;
it seemed as though she were running smash
into the land but there was a way that opened
thinly before her scudding bow.</p>
<p>Once the keel groaned and rasped on coral,
and once a bough was snapped on a tree leaning
far over the water by the short mast.</p>
<p>Then they were in open water. Would the
cutter know where they went? Would she follow?</p>
<p>They squared away and ran, full speed, down
the Sound, and with keel almost aground,
shoved&mdash;literally grated their way&mdash;over a bar
and into the outer waters again.</p>
<p>And the cutter had not followed!</p>
<p>She had done better! Anticipating some such
double-back among the waterways, she had
eased her way and lay beyond the reef. With
a word of muttered anger, the captain rushed
for the pilot house in the forward end of the
cabin.</p>
<p>The small cannon on the revenue cutter
spoke with its sharp bark but the phantom
cruiser did not heave to. Instead her engines
fairly shook her hull in their race for freedom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Fast as she was the revenue cutter was not
fast enough to overtake the other. Her gun
spoke, but at a distant range and on a bad target&mdash;the
tail of a flying ship without lights is
no easy thing to hit in the dark!</p>
<p>The cutter dropped back slowly and then,
sure that they were no longer in sight of her
watchful crew, the hi-jackers flung their tiller
hard a-starboard, heeled with the swerve and
their speed, heard the grate of coral on one
side, and&mdash;were again in a hidden cove!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">DISASTER!</span></span></h2>
<p>Clearly the churns saw that, although the
hi-jackers had escaped for a time, they were
really trapped. The <i>Senorita</i>, their cruiser, if
she lay where she was until dawn, must be discovered.</p>
<p>Within the Sound, reached with such daring
and risk, there was no safety, now that
Uncle Sam&rsquo;s watchdog had their scent, so to
speak.</p>
<p>But, with the perversity which Nature seems
sometimes to show, the elements played a card
in favor of the evil-doers. Heavy rain squalls
came up, and the wind blew the water in sheets
that made a perfect screen for a slipping, silent
gray shape.</p>
<p>Captain Ortiga took quick advantage of his
fortune. The gray <i>Senorita</i> nosed out into
Little Card Sound, crossed its end, skirting the
shore, and, again at the outlet, nosed quietly,
slowly out toward freedom. In the downpour
it was unlikely that they could be sighted and
the propeller thrash would be deadened by the
wind and waves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a scheme,&rdquo; whispered Nicky, as the
chums stood at the bow, straining their eyes
hopefully into the downpour, themselves heedless
of the rain that stung their faces. Tew,
with surprising kindliness, had loaned them oil-skins
from the &ldquo;slop chest&rdquo; or supply reserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your plan?&rdquo; queried Tom, lips close
to Nicky&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Three heads drew together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the little steerman&rsquo;s cubby at the
front of the cabin, just now,&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;I
saw the place where the electric buttons are
set. They control the electric lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; Cliff broke in. &ldquo;You
want to get in there and work the electric
lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then the cutter will see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom raised an objection. &ldquo;If she chases us
again,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;she will fire until she hits
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;This time she
won&rsquo;t give up until she captures&mdash;or sinks us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a risk, I know,&rdquo; Nicky admitted. &ldquo;She
won&rsquo;t know we are on board and she will have
a right to sink these fellows. But it would be
one way to help to capture&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom spoke practically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;What good will it do us to have this boat
sunk?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;In this rough water we
wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance to be picked up, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is too dangerous,&rdquo; Nicky admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait,&rdquo; Cliff suggested. &ldquo;We will get
our chance. The right must win or there
wouldn&rsquo;t be any justice in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched eagerly for any sign of the
cutter but Captain Ortiga stood well out from
land before he swung west. The chums saw
that the chances for the cutter to discover them
were remote and went back into the cabin
where they were assigned to berths.</p>
<p>But if the weather had seemed to aid the
wrong side, there was another card to be played
and it came as a surprise.</p>
<p>Instead of lying-to, close to land, the cutter
had stood out to the deeper channels also!</p>
<p>There came a warning call from the man on
watch on top of the cabin, echoed by the one
at the bows. &ldquo;Hard a-port!&rdquo; was the call, &ldquo;something
ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys dashed again to the deck.</p>
<p>They quickly discerned the dim shape toward
which the <i>Senorita</i> had been directly advancing.</p>
<p>Had they, too, been sighted?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>The <i>Senorita</i> swerved from her course, and
made almost a right angle to her former course,
though, of course, on a wide curve!</p>
<p>That swung them in toward land, again, for
it was the safer way. Then, on a quartering
line, partly on the true path and partly drawing
toward land, they held steadily on.</p>
<p>There came across the water a vivid flash,
but the wind swept away the cutter&rsquo;s voice as
her cannon spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead!&rdquo; was the order to the engineer.</p>
<p>The <i>Senorita</i> trembled and strove, and behind
her the cutter, her headway increasing,
again took up the chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s behind us now, and she may have
to turn around&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t see which was her
bow, she was so far away,&rdquo; Cliff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half afraid we&rsquo;ll show her our heels,&rdquo;
Tom whispered. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m half glad. If we
can get to an island or close enough to swim
to one, they can sink her and welcome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky agreed.</p>
<p>From the stem they watched the chase. Several
shots were fired at them, but they could
guess, by the diminishing light of each succeeding
flash, that they were drawing away
from the cutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t give up,&rdquo; Nicky proclaimed.
&ldquo;She will hang on like a bulldog.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Don Ortiga doesn&rsquo;t give up
the run for the archipelago and stand out to
sea?&rdquo; Tom said.</p>
<p>Captain Ortiga had a different plan. He
knew that the Government boat would never
give up, and he wished to use that very point
for his own advantage. He planned to make
the other boat very sure that he would continue
along the Cape Sable coastline. He wished
them to follow.</p>
<p>Therefore, to the chums&rsquo; amazement, he
caused the mast light to be switched on, and
even reduced their speed a little, so that the
cutter would pursue, but would be just out of
dangerous range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he doing this?&rdquo; Nicky wondered.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out! We&rsquo;re part of his crew, aren&rsquo;t
we? He ought to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff laughed at Nicky&rsquo;s assumption that they
were real hi-jackers, but the trio trooped into
the cabin. They found Mate Tew there, going
over some of the weapons in the arsenal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my hearties!&rdquo; Tew explained, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
this way. Don Ortiga&rsquo;s got a grudge ag&rsquo;inst
them Government snoopers! He hates &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ortiga, Nicky mused, seemed to have a
grudge against almost everybody&mdash;the government
men, his brother&mdash;who else?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to lure them where he can&mdash;do&mdash;what
he plans&mdash;&rdquo; He did not make the plan
clear but the chums felt that it was a very serious
danger into which their countrymen, pursuing
their duty, were being led.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run up along them islands,&rdquo; Tew went
on, &ldquo;to the mouth o&rsquo; the Shark River. O&rsquo;
course it ain&rsquo;t rightly the mouth o&rsquo; the river,
out there in them islands&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a channel
through &rsquo;em opposite the Shark&mdash;that&rsquo;s about
fifteen miles back, at the mainland edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; Nicky inquired
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have the <i>Senorita</i> well in the
mouth o&rsquo; the river, come dawn! Then we lands,
see? Then we waits. O&rsquo; course they&rsquo;ll run up
along the islands and if they miss us, well an&rsquo;
good&mdash;but if they turn and come into the inner
channel and spot us, they&rsquo;ll put a crew onto the
deserted <i>Senorita</i>, and keep some on their cutter&mdash;and
then&mdash;we&rsquo;ll spring a little surprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little sleep for the excited chums
during that night. It was quiet enough, and
uneventful; but they were so excited and
&ldquo;worked up&rdquo; that they could not stop discussing
the situation long enough to fall asleep.</p>
<p>They made good progress and when the
sound of running feet and low orders came,
they all rose from their bunks and ran on deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you know the channel?&rdquo; Tew
was asking, as they came up to him and Captain
Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the latter, shortly. &ldquo;You
stand by to pass the word quickly to the man
at the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first faint dawn light was visible in the
East. Ahead were dim blotches on the water;
to the right lay many other gloomy shapes.
There seemed to be a wider space off the bow
at one point. The order was given, the vessel
swung her course toward the break and, still at
good speed, bore on.</p>
<p>The dim islets closed in on each side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starboard a point,&rdquo; called the captain from
the bows, his eyes probing the dark, just
faintly glimmering water, &ldquo;starboard a point!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starboard a point!&rdquo; relayed Tew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starboard a point it is!&rdquo; the helmsman, at
his little wheel, drew down the spokes to the
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port&mdash;port two points!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port&mdash;two points!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port two it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard a-port! Hard a-port&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard a-port&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a shout of dismay, a call from the
pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiller rope&rsquo;s broken!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the engines&mdash;hard a-starboard&mdash;hard
over&mdash;reverse her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were shouts, cries, dismayed questions,
a jangle of a bell.</p>
<p>The whole fabric of the vessel seemed to
shudder as if in the grip of an earthquake. The
engines had not been stopped and reversed in
time. The captain shouted and at the same instant
there was a rasping rending sound&mdash;a
sickening sound&mdash;a tearing, grinding, splintering
as the ship tore her side on coral&mdash;and
stopped, settling gently on her side!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">CAPTAIN NICKY TAKES COMMAND</span></span></h2>
<p>There was every kind of excitement on the
<i>Senorita</i>! Men rushed this way and that; they
came together in excited groups, spoke quickly
together, separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cutter&rsquo;ll be on us any minute!&rdquo; said a
deckhand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no place to stand &rsquo;em off!&rdquo; grunted
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great captain, dat Don!&rdquo; grumbled the cook.
&ldquo;Know de channel! Huh! Look whah we&rsquo;s at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower the tender!&rdquo; called Tew. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get
away. Grab what you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bettah we do dat!&rdquo; agreed the cook.
&ldquo;Ashore we gits tuh hide; heah dey kin shell us
out-a de watah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom gripped Nicky&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get there so they won&rsquo;t forget and
leave us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; urged Nicky. &ldquo;Wait&mdash;come on with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Cliff. &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Nicky demanded of his chums.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;&rdquo; began Cliff. Then he
followed Nicky.</p>
<p>The self-appointed leader went hastily down
into the forecastle. His two comrades followed,
wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo; began Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it this way,&rdquo; begged Nicky. &ldquo;If we
go with them we are in their hands, aren&rsquo;t we?
When the cutter has come and gone, without
finding anything but the wrecked boat, these
men will want to make us tell them where the
treasure is supposed to be. Then they&rsquo;ll desert
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good common sense,&rdquo; agreed Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Tom nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go in the tender,&rdquo; Nicky pursued
his argument. &ldquo;Then we can take possession
of this boat, and when the cutter comes we can
signal, and then&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there some reward for
claiming salvage on a boat, some way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get a treasure out of this
adventure somehow, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; laughed Tom.
&ldquo;I never saw such a money-grabbing fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I do&mdash;we do&mdash;or not,&rdquo; Nicky defended,
&ldquo;we are safer here than with those hi-jackers.
If the cutter doesn&rsquo;t come, we have
all the food and things&mdash;maybe the arsenal.
We can stand them off and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of them making us toe the mark,
we can make them do it!&rdquo; Cliff cried, fired by
Nicky&rsquo;s eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;Nicky has the
right idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tender, which was used with muffled
oars according to need, had by that time been
lowered over the slanting side of the <i>Senorita</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose she sinks!&rdquo; a new thought came
to Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The channels can&rsquo;t be very deep, even at the
deepest, between these islands,&rdquo; Nicky asserted.
&ldquo;I think she has settled onto the rock now. If
she starts down we can almost jump onto that
island&mdash;and we won&rsquo;t be as badly off as in the
hands of hi-jackers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gathering most of their weapons and some
supplies and dropping them into the boat, the
crew hurriedly rowed away on the course toward
the distant mainland and the mouth of
the Shark River where they could hide for a
time.</p>
<p>Tom, Cliff and Nicky assured that the ship
was completely deserted except for themselves,
came on deck and from the points of vantage
watched the departure without disclosing themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The cutter, in the meantime, had pursued to
the best of her speed during most of the night,
but when the <i>Senorita</i> rounded the western end
of Cape Sable and was, for the time, out of
sight of her pursuer, a man on the cutter
sighted what he took to be her lights again.</p>
<p>They were not, however. A coasting schooner,
of the old type, blown somewhat off her course,
had hove in sight.</p>
<p>Naturally, not being aware of the true facts,
and supposing that the quarry had doubled on
her course to escape them, believing that her
masthead light&mdash;which the schooner&rsquo;s light,
from the rear, closely duplicated, was that of
the <i>Senorita</i>, the cutter changed her course.</p>
<p>By dawn she overhauled the schooner, saw
her mistake and lay to, her commander and Mr.
Neale and the others completely baffled.</p>
<p>Had they been pursing that schooner all the
while?</p>
<p>At the same time Nicky was delivering an
oration, on the silent, stricken <i>Senorita</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have to organize.
We&rsquo;re the captain, and crew, and cook
and cabin boy, all in three. Which is which?
If the cutter doesn&rsquo;t come, we have to make
plans. Those men will come back. They may
not be able to use this boat again but they will
want to find out what we know about the treasure
before they leave&mdash;and they may do something
to us after we&rsquo;ve told. We &lsquo;signed on&rsquo;
in a way as pirates&mdash;hi-jackers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, sure enough, we are hi-jackers!&rdquo; exclaimed
Cliff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve taken a whole ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Well, I move that
the Mystery Boys nominate the acting chief for
this year of their order as Captain in this
emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; cried Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in favor!&rdquo; grinned Nicky. &ldquo;But Tom
has the cooler head and you, Cliff, know more
than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye&mdash;just the same&mdash;you&rsquo;re elected!&rdquo;
laughed Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll volunteer to cook,&rdquo; Tom offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m crew and cabin boy,&rdquo; chuckled
Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your orders, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; asked Tom
with assumed deference, touching his forelock
in approved nautical fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we all are captain, really,&rdquo; Nicky
stated. &ldquo;But just while we&rsquo;re in no danger,
I&rsquo;d say we ought to see what weapons the men
left, and where the food is and how badly
broken the hull is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one job for each of us,&rdquo; Cliff agreed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll round up the artillery. Tom will cook, so
that leaves the captain the rightful duty of estimating
damage to his ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may try to repair her,&rdquo; grinned
Nicky, &ldquo;and sail, and sail the seven seas, and
spread our sails to every breeze and take our
captives as we please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only we have no sails!&rdquo; Cliff reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll gaily man our ocean rover
and swiftly turn her engines over and if we&rsquo;re
chased&mdash;if we&rsquo;re chased&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run for cover!&rdquo; suggested Tom, chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rover&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t rhyme with &lsquo;cover&rsquo; but let
it go at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with the spirit of youth and daring
alert in their strange situation, they departed
for their several tasks.</p>
<p>Over a plentiful breakfast, helping to make
up for the fast of the long day on the island,
they compared notes. There was a long rent
in the vessel&rsquo;s side, below waterline, Nicky reported,
not easily to be repaired even if they
could float the ship at all. Plenty of canned
food and some fresh supplies, Tom stated. Five
automatic pistols, two rifles and a small signaling
cannon was Cliff&rsquo;s list of weapons. &ldquo;So
far, so good,&rdquo; said Nicky. &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>From a little beyond the ship came a hail.</p>
<p>The chums became tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re captain,&rdquo; his chums told Nicky. &ldquo;Go
and parley!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">A PARLEY AND A PLAN</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, <i>Senorita</i>!&rdquo; came the second hail.
Nicky scrambled from his wicker chair and
started for the companion door; Tom looked at
Cliff and then, catching his eye, glanced at the
arsenal. Cliff nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if the rifles are loaded,&rdquo; Tom
commented, picking one up and breaking the
breach&mdash;with a shake of his head closing it.
&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t. But they may come in handy.&rdquo;
They carried the weapons as they came on deck.</p>
<p>Nicky had taken a position beside the little
wheelhouse, watching the tender, manned by
Tew and one sailor, come around the islet close
to which their boat was careened against the
coral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; hailed Tew, catching sight of Nicky.
&ldquo;You boys got lost in the shuffle! Thought you
was overboard maybe. We&rsquo;ll take you off. We
are hidin&rsquo; on a good island&mdash;we can climb the
trees and be safe when the cutter comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff and Tom ranged up beside Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going, are we?&rdquo; whispered Cliff.
Nicky shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay away!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going
to leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff and Tom, rifles held in a menacing position,
ranged up beside Nicky. The sailor
stopped rowing, allowing the tender to drift
about fifteen feet from the <i>Senorita</i>. Tew muttered
some unpleasant word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be there when the revenue
men come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you do, we don&rsquo;t
mean you to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to the sailor, but in face of two
rifles, the man said something under his breath
and Tew nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Tew called, &ldquo;if they get you
you&rsquo;ll tell where we are! That won&rsquo;t do! Come&mdash;be
sensible&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get you one way or another.
Come decent, and we won&rsquo;t harm you&mdash;but
come you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky defiantly.
&ldquo;Well we won&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;d better go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tew and the sailor held a short conference.
At Tew&rsquo;s gesture the sailor poised the oars,
while Tew tugged at a weapon in his belt. Tom
leaped up onto the cabin roof, to have a better
place from which to pretend to cover the sailor,
but an inspiration came to him and he acted
upon that instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Pretending to glance by accident toward the
larger expanse of the open Gulf he dropped the
rifle, and waved his arm, then dragged out a
handkerchief and waved that wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Cutter&mdash;ahoy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a common fear Tew snatched up a
second pair of oars as the sailor, with a mighty
heave on one oar, began to swing his tender in
a circle; then both began to row away around
the islet with all their strength, while Nicky
and Tom, seeing Cliff&rsquo;s deception, and knowing
that it had succeeded because the men thought
they could see from the cabin top what was invisible
on the water line, leaped up beside their
comrade and began to hail and to wave their
arms.</p>
<p>The tender was quickly out of their sight,
and yet they kept up their shouting, until, at
a sign from Cliff, they desisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s over&mdash;for the time!&rdquo; Cliff said
thankfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re worse off than ever,&rdquo; Tom added.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll watch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No they won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Nicky argued. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
hide. We are not so badly off. We can load
the guns and if we have to we can shoot over
their heads when they come back after us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they have guns, too,&rdquo; objected Cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Nicky proposed, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fix the cabin
so we can take refuge there, barricade it.
There&rsquo;s all the food for a long siege, and we
can command the doors from those portholes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom caught their arms, and with a swift
whisper and a nod toward a moving figure on
the islet, caused them to begin to wave their
hands and to beckon, all looking out toward the
Gulf.</p>
<p>Tom had espied a creeping figure, low on the
ground. Tew, with some purpose in his mind,
had landed on the islet and crept across to the
side nearest the stranded vessel. Cliff covered
him and called softly, &ldquo;Stay where you are,
Mr. Tew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure on the ground flattened and
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you&mdash;I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to hurt
you!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;How clost are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half a mile off the coast,&rdquo; Nicky answered,
hoping his untruth would be forgiven
under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to warn you&mdash;if you let them
take you off, don&rsquo;t say nothing about us&mdash;and
then no harm&rsquo;ll come to you. But if any of
us gets nabbed&mdash;we&rsquo;ll take care not all are&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
hunt you down if it takes all our lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; called Tom quickly, neither
agreeing nor refusing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Tew waited a moment, then seemed to decide
that he had better not stay there since they
had discovered him and he could not watch.
He crept back out of sight at the far side of
the islet, behind its small, tangled trees and
bushes, and the chums turned again to their
plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of you go down and see if the cabin
doors can be fastened,&rdquo; Nicky urged. &ldquo;Tom&mdash;you
go! Cliff, can&rsquo;t that skylight on top of the
cabin be battened down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;there&rsquo;s a covering&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it won&rsquo;t help once they get on top&mdash;but
having it fastened would make it take
longer to get to us. And we&rsquo;d have the light
switches and could light the mast light if they
come at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom returned to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either of you got a screw driver blade on
your jackknife?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I closed the cabin
door, but the lock sticks and when I wrenched
at the knob to open it again, the screw was
loose that holds the knob to the shackle, and
it just turned in my hand and I had to screw
in the threads with my finger nail to get it to
turn at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one,&rdquo; said Cliff, but as he produced
his knife he went on, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to have you
listen to a different plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Nicky and Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with the cabin is that they can
come at it from the after deck, at the blank
rear bulkhead back of the engines, and we can&rsquo;t
cover the decks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Nicky conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think we ought to do some other way,&rdquo;
Cliff urged. &ldquo;And I wish you&rsquo;d tell me what
you think of this: Suppose we take it for
granted that they won&rsquo;t come back for at least
an hour&mdash;they will scatter and hide because
they don&rsquo;t know but that the cutter may be
coming. In that time we can swim over to that
island with the heavy trees, after we&rsquo;ve dumped
the guns into the water and flung things around
to make them think the cutter&rsquo;s men have
searched a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a corker!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky. &ldquo;Much
better than my plan. They will think the cutter
took us off and we were too scared to tell where
they were, and then they won&rsquo;t come back or
bother us any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea,&rdquo; Cliff nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>They lost no time carrying it out. Tossing
a good deal of dunnage out of cupboards, to
simulate the result of a hurried search for
liquor or evidence, and dropping the rifles overboard
where they showed on the clear bed of
coral, as they supposed the officers would do,
the chums, carefully making certain by shinning
up the short mast that no boat was within
immediate range, leaped over the side.</p>
<p>The deeper channel was not wide; they made
for an island on the far side, and there, wading
up through the ooze covered bed-stone, they
got on fairly firm ground and selected good
spots in which to lie in case of need for hiding.</p>
<p>Then, by turns, they took up a watch toward
the Gulf, alternating with a look once in a while
toward the channel and the wrecked boat.</p>
<p>But for some reason the hi-jackers did not
return. All day the chums watched, but without
result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have decided that we went away,
or they are afraid that a rowboat might be
cruising among the islets,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;I wish
we had brought something to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of it,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;but I guessed
that they would come back before night and
then leave us alone. And no cutter has shown
itself. Well&mdash;shall we swim back before dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; counseled Cliff, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s wait. They may
come back after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Night closed down clear and with the stars
very bright it was possible to watch easily.
And, about eight o&rsquo;clock, Tom, on guard, whispered
to attract his comrades. They all made
out the tender creeping quietly toward the careening
hulk across the channel from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could get their boat&mdash;&rdquo; Cliff
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we can!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s swim back closer and see what we can
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they discover us&mdash;&rdquo; objected Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t looking for us, I feel sure,&rdquo;
Cliff said. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be watching the water
in this direction. They are getting their food
and things, it is most likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going carefully, using a stroke that sent
them through the water with little sound, they
soon came close enough to see clearly the situation.
One man sat, apparently waiting, in the
tender, at the forward quarter; the chums held
their breath and let themselves sink to the lowest
point they could, till their feet touched the
bottom, when they discovered him. But, either
because he was half asleep, or from confidence
that there was no one around, he sat slumped
in the stern, and did not appear to notice anything
unusual.</p>
<p>Treading water, catching finally the low rail
where it almost dipped into the limpid water,
at the shore side of the listing boat, Nicky, Cliff
and Tom drew close together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>There was no one on deck. From the cabin
came sounds of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see&mdash;&rdquo; whispered Cliff, and he
began to climb up cautiously onto the deck.
Nicky and Tom followed his example, but remained
at the rail as he made a peremptory
gesture to them to &ldquo;stay back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff crept closer to the cabin and when no
one appeared and his courage rose, he became
bolder and slipped on his wet feet to the cabin
doorway. He listened a moment and then crept
back to his chums and whispered rapidly.</p>
<p>Taking Cliff&rsquo;s screwdriver-bladed knife, Tom
went to the rearward door, into the engine
room, and with the knife removed the screw
from its knob, leaving the inner side of the door
with no means of opening it. Then he &ldquo;stood
by,&rdquo; watching, listening.</p>
<p>In the bows, hiding his face, using as gruff
an imitation of Tew&rsquo;s voice as he could, Cliff
hailed the man in the boat in a low tone. &ldquo;Come
into the cabin, you,&rdquo; he said. Then he hurried
away.</p>
<p>Presently those in the cabin&mdash;Don Ortiga,
Tew, their sailors and the cook, were surprised
to see the boatman appear in their midst.</p>
<p>Before they could question him or get his inquiry
as to what they wanted, the door behind
him slammed as did the engine room door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>There was confusion, then oaths, then excited
stamping; of course the time it took them to
discover that they were trapped was not long;
nor did it take overlong to get the knob back
onto the door after an excited hand wrenched it
away. But the time was enough.</p>
<p>When the infuriated members of the hi-jacker
band finally raced up the deck toward
their tender, they found the dipped end of a
rope as a memento.</p>
<p>The Mystery Boys, well away and out of
sight around the island, were rowing the captured
tender with all their strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;claim salvage!&rdquo; panted Nicky.
&ldquo;But we are out of the grip of those men&mdash;and
we have a boat&mdash;we&rsquo;re free men again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a light&mdash;a boat or something,
up the coast,&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Nicky, pull hard on
your port oar&mdash;you too, Cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o!&rdquo; they answered with a will, pulling
the tender on a swinging curve. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull
for it. It may be the cutter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was stationary, and not very far away;
but as they neared it they saw that it was not
the cutter.</p>
<p>It was another cabin boat, lying, apparently,
at anchor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Cautioning his chums not to hail until they
knew whether it was a suitable craft for their
rescue, they drew slowly closer.</p>
<p>From the vessel came a gruff hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you covered!&rdquo; it cried. &ldquo;Two of
you put your hands up, and one pull your boat
up alongside till we have a look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the frying pan&mdash;&rdquo; breathed Cliff! He
and Tom elevated their hands and Nicky, with
reluctant strokes, drew close to the bow. Tom
discerned a name in glimmering gold against
white paint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; he whimpered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that boat we
saw in Jamaica!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was&mdash;<i>El Libertad</i>!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">A SURPRISE!</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice way to welcome mariners!&rdquo;
exclaimed Cliff as they came alongside; the
colored man on deck merely grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass your line!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When they clambered onto the small aft deck
they saw that their new captor was a large,
heavy, but lithe-looking negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to go away, before,&rdquo; he said,
more pleasantly. &ldquo;When I saw you this time I
wouldn&rsquo;t take chances on letting you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Nicky demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s this way: we
got the maps back in Jamaica, and got <i>El
Libertad</i> ready. When you tried to hire her
Senor Ortiga let your chief think she was laid
up waiting for machinery&mdash;but before you were
ten miles away we started for the archipelago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose it was one of your crowd
who tried to scare us with the blue light and
rapping on the sloop,&rdquo; cried Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was me,&rdquo; he answered, not very grammatically.
&ldquo;I used a blue ship&rsquo;s flare we had
on the boat, burned in a box so you only saw
the light and not the flame. Then I swam out
under water and hit the sloop and then coaxed
you back to the island with another flare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you who put the message there,&rdquo;
Tom exclaimed, feeling somewhat ashamed of
his terror of the past, now that a perfectly
natural explanation made it all seem so easy
to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it there, but Cap&rsquo;n Ortiga, he planned
it&mdash;with the man who got the maps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who was that?&rdquo; demanded Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; declared the colored man.
&ldquo;Come this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led them into the cabin, a much smaller
one than on the <i>Senorita</i>, since the <i>Libertad</i>
was a narrower, shorter vessel.</p>
<p>Under the ceiling electric dome two men sat
at a table, playing some game of cards. The
man facing them was of Spanish type, not as
tall or as excitable as his brother, but clearly
related to the hi-jacker they had just before
their escape been able to imprison in his own
cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>He looked up and as the man whose back
was toward them did so and made a half turn
on his folding seat, all three boys started and
their jaws dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Coleson!&rdquo; gasped Nicky.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Coleson all right&mdash;the owner of
the plantation where they had stayed in Jamaica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, young fellows!&rdquo; he replied briskly,
swinging further around in his chair. &ldquo;So you
came back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still speechless with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather glad you did,&rdquo; Mr. Coleson went
on. &ldquo;Did you find any treasure?&rdquo; He turned
a grinning face to wink at Senor Ortiga who
frowned heavily at the boys.</p>
<p>Nicky shook his head. &ldquo;You know right well
we didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You sent us away
to have a clear field here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless I gather that there is treasure
buried in such spots,&rdquo; said Mr. Coleson. &ldquo;You
might have found some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found something else, though,&rdquo; said
Nicky, fixing a meaning look upon the
Spaniard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liquor! Of course!&rdquo; Rodriguez Ortiga
agreed shortly. &ldquo;How did it happen that my
beloved brother didn&rsquo;t put an end to you&mdash;I
rather expected that he would!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Tom was caressing his left ear rather hurriedly;
Nicky, lips half open, suddenly recognized
the sign of their secret call for a council,
or for silence, and folded his arms.</p>
<p>Cliff took up the answer to Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother,&rdquo; he said, meaningly, &ldquo;has a
better use for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ortiga leaned back, scowling, looking sharply
at the trio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what does that mean?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; Cliff said. Ortiga pursued the
inquiry but with Cliff the others remained stubbornly
silent. They saw that Cliff&rsquo;s plan, for
some reason they did not yet grasp, was to
puzzle the two men. Nicky, to get away from
the subject, turned on the estate owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to be on this boat?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Coleson, smiling a little, answered
readily. &ldquo;Quite simple. You see, I have the
maps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get them?&rdquo; Tom broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Equally simple, my lad. I was not far away
when I observed your little difficulty with the
voodoo woman, and being curious, half intending
to interfere, I came closer, just beyond the
heavy fringe of brush near the cabin. From
there I overheard enough of your talk with Sam
to become interested. I followed you three and
since you held your supposedly secret meeting
quite close to my own windows I overheard
some more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The trio of chums felt sheepish. For once
their mysteries had been carelessly pursued;
they had talked openly instead of by signs, as
they all recalled clearly on looking back upon
that day of many excitements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing the island superstitions, it was
easy to frighten the child&mdash;the little negro boy&mdash;I
merely held a handkerchief over my face as
I crouched by the dining room window, watching
for a chance to get the map you were discussing.
My white suit accomplished the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had worn a light suit, as did most of the
people of Jamaica, the youths recollected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to have to strike Sam, but I saw
that your part of the chart was insufficient and
so I took the balance from Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very easy to see, now that you explain
it,&rdquo; said Nicky, ruefully recalling that
they had attached some ghostly importance to
perfectly ordinary causes. Nicky also recalled
that Mr. Coleson had, himself, that night, mentioned
the ghosts&mdash;for his own purpose, it now
became clear!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you climbed into a window after
you got our map,&rdquo; said Tom, vowing mentally
never to accept a single ghostly bit of evidence
again as long as he lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did better than that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Coleson,
appearing to take a grim delight in explaining
how easily he had hoodwinked them. &ldquo;I
merely crouched beside the white part of the
house, back of the shrubbery. You looked all
about except right behind you, that time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here!&rdquo; cut in Ortiga, &ldquo;what is it
that my brother has use for you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the chums became silent; actually,
there was no answer but they pretended mystifying
knowledge, in a way paying back the debt
they owed Mr. Coleson and the colored man for
the blue light and old tin can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;now that we shall
use you first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use us?&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;Use us for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his turn Ortiga smiled enigmatically.</p>
<p>Mr. Coleson spoke. &ldquo;You see, boys,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;we have the maps, and we have cruised among
the islands for days&mdash;but we haven&rsquo;t located
the Dipper Islands&mdash;and, of course, no treasure
is found. You must have the clue we lack. We
will share with you after you help us to find
the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we won&rsquo;t help?&rdquo; inquired Nicky
defiantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ours by right. And, suppose
we don&rsquo;t even know a clue?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first case, we will find ways to make
you tell,&rdquo; snapped Senor Ortiga, with a clenching
fist crumpling the hand of cards he held.
&ldquo;In the latter case&mdash;we won&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky turned with helpless dismay to his two
chums. They still had their arms folded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing!&rdquo; was the sign Tom made and
Nicky nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose my brother has learned from you
about the treasure,&rdquo; said Ortiga, rising. &ldquo;That
is what he would use you for. Well&mdash;we will
be just a little ahead of him&mdash;as usual!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once, as they sprawled on the cushioned
side seats which had to serve as bunks, the
three comrades admitted to their own secret
selves, although not to each other, that there
seemed to be no way out of this dilemma. For
once their self-reliance was a very small spark,
indeed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the right always wins out somehow,&rdquo;
Nicky consoled himself. &ldquo;If it didn&rsquo;t then the
world would have been smashed up long ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, a little braced by his trust, he dozed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">CAPTAIN KIDD&rsquo;S MESSAGE</span></span></h2>
<p>When they awoke the three comrades found
their clothes, soaked by their swim the night
before, dry enough to put on. There was very
little conversation during breakfast, but immediately
after the meal Senor Ortiga drew from
his pocket the two halves of Captain Kidd&rsquo;s
map, laid them on the folding table and summoned
the boys to his side.</p>
<p>There were the two halves of the real map,
together for the first time in Nicky&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>The two halves fitted exactly when Mr. Coleson
held them together. They showed the complete
sign of the Dipper, with small islands
indicating a very close resemblance to the real
constellation of the heavens, as the chums saw
it at night. Beneath them, the two separated
syllables formed, as they had inferred, the
name Dipper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The faint line, zigzagging among the small
and irregular dots below, ran from the wreck to
a point at what was the eastward of the reproduced
constellation; but the line ended without
pointing to any particular islet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your map,&rdquo; Mr. Coleson said. &ldquo;Now,
lads, you can see that it means very little. It
shows the point where the wreck occurred many
years ago. It shows a channel that must have
been used by the castaways in transferring the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Don Ortiga broke in, irritably, &ldquo;we
have located the islands that make the Dipper&mdash;they
lie inward about half way between the
Gulf side and the inside channel. And we
have dug every one of them over, torn roots
apart, plumbed with leads and grappled with
hooks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all we&rsquo;ve got for our work,&rdquo; Mr. Coleson
growled, &ldquo;is the ache in our backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing on the chart to indicate
where the treasure was put,&rdquo; Ortiga commented.
&ldquo;Unless you know something about it
that we do not see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Coleson.</p>
<p>His look penetrated the eager interest of the
boys and he thought he saw something in
Nicky&rsquo;s expression that meant more than it
showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;Nicky, aren&rsquo;t you?&mdash;you know something,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;Now, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Cliff and Tom also saw a strange expression
in Nicky&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Nicky had just recollected
a part of his family&rsquo;s legend that had
not come into his mind before for the reason
that it was not written down anywhere and had
been told to him only once by his uncle.</p>
<p>Nicky, glancing at his two young companions,
wanted to smile. Both were making vigorous
efforts to make him realize that they were signaling;
each scratched a left ear almost wildly.
It was the call for a secret communication.</p>
<p>Nicky folded his arms and stood, pretending
to pore over the map, his brows knitted. He
was watching for the next sign, although he
already sensed what it would be.</p>
<p>His guess was correct. Cliff was making
the sign to call for the part of their oath that
said &ldquo;Telling All, I tell nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky, deliberately, grinned at his chums.</p>
<p>Turning to Mr. Coleson Nicky made a flat
statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do know something!&rdquo;
Everyone bent forward. Ortiga and Mr. Coleson
had eager, intent faces; Cliff and Tom were
anxious and worried. With the key to a treasure
in his grasp, was this impulsive comrade going
to &ldquo;tell All,&rdquo; or &ldquo;tell nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Nicky grinned, a little maliciously, it seemed
to Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Coleson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got us &lsquo;in
your power.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s no use to try to fib to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not!&rdquo; snapped Senor Ortiga,
while the colored man, listening in the after
cockpit, rolled his eyes and shook his head and
Mr. Coleson bored Nicky with piercing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to save my friends and myself,&rdquo;
Nicky declared. &ldquo;If you will promise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Certainly!&rdquo; broke in Senor Ortiga,
impatiently. &ldquo;You will get what is coming to
you! Let us have the secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky&rsquo;s chums were so far forgetting their
usual poise that they shook their heads vigorously,
but Nicky seemed not to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Captain Kidd was in prison, as my
family remembers the story, he sent for one of
my grandparents&mdash;great-great-great, I guess it
was! And he said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Here is half a map, and I am
giving it to you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind all that!&rdquo; rasped Mr. Coleson.
&ldquo;Get to the point!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said, and traced the faint line
with his finger. They followed his movement
in fascinated eagerness. &ldquo;You see, it finally
runs around the top of the islands, the North
part, and then straight as an arrow, points
South!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We see that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the message Captain Kidd gave was,
as well as I can repeat it&mdash;&lsquo;At the end of the
line, in the lowest part of the Dipper!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the end of the line, in the lowest part
of the Dipper!&rsquo;&rdquo; Ortiga repeated. He snatched
the map and pulled it closer. He studied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The line points South,&rdquo; Nicky said, &ldquo;so I
suppose Captain Kidd meant to dig or search
down at the part that is the lowest part on the
chart. That would be&mdash;&rdquo; He fished out a
stubby bit of pencil and placed its tip on the
Westernmost of the lowest islands, drew a slim
line from it to the one opposite, at the East, prolonged
the line until it was at a point below the
end of the faint line already on the chart. Then
he made dots to prolong that one until they met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed Senor Ortiga, leaping
up in such excitement that he threw over
his chair and almost upset the table. &ldquo;We did
not think of that place. We dug all the islands,
but this is far better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;Jim, get the boat ready! We will
go at once!&rdquo; cried Mr. Coleson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for you fellows,&rdquo; said Senor Ortiga,
&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t take you; we can&rsquo;t trust you with the
<i>Libertad</i>. So we will tie you until we return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of vigorous protests, the powerful
men quickly overcame opposition, bound ropes
around the boys&rsquo; arms and legs, knotted them,
dropped the helpless bundles unceremoniously
on the cabin floor, and hurried to climb into
their own rowboat and the tender which had
brought the chums. The quick orders, followed
by a rythmic plash of oars and voices dying
away gradually in the distance was the story
their ears told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice one!&rdquo; said Cliff, sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Nicky, wrenching futilely at his
well-trussed arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we&rsquo;d signalled, and all,&rdquo; Tom cut in.
&ldquo;Tell all, and tell nothing&mdash;oh, yes! Then you
tell all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo; demanded
Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave them a false direction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; asked Nicky and worked again
on his bonds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">NICKY CHANGES A WORD!</span></span></h2>
<p>Cramped and aching in every muscle, the
chums struggled uselessly throughout a long
and irksome day. The ropes were tied too securely
to be loosened; they would not stretch.</p>
<p>It was almost twilight when they heard the
returning sweep of oars and the grate of the
boats alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, see if those lads are still safe, and let
them stretch a bit,&rdquo; came a voice the chums
recognized as that of Mr. Coleson. Jim, the
colored Jamaican, came into the cabin with
leisurely slowness and they saw, from his downcast
face, the answer to a question in the minds
of at least two cramped prisoners.</p>
<p>He was frowning and his whole bearing was
dejected. They had found no treasure!</p>
<p>This was borne out by the faces of the white
men when they came in and dropped heavily
onto the cushioned side seats. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo;
said Senor Ortiga, morosely, fixing Nicky with
a cold glare, &ldquo;are you sure you remembered
that message correctly?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Nicky, rubbing his arms and
legs to get the blood into circulation again, still
seated on the cabin flooring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Coleson, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all a
myth, or someone has been ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat that message,&rdquo; commanded Ortiga,
not convinced.</p>
<p>Nicky, looking him in the eyes, did so. &ldquo;&lsquo;At
the end of the line, in the lowest part of the
Dipper,&rsquo;&rdquo; he stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say that&rsquo;s the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and &lsquo;nothing but the truth!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we searched the bottom where those
lines join, and then we rowed over to the
two islands, went over them again, and then
searched the bottom between them&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
&lsquo;lowest part of the islands,&rsquo; too,&rdquo; stated Mr.
Coleson.</p>
<p>Neither Nicky, Cliff nor Tom cared much.
Their bodies were too sore, too tired from staying
in one position, too full of aches, to enable
them to give much thought to treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Almost nothing was said as Jim prepared
supper, for which the chums were waiting as
eagerly as their weary bodies allowed. A low-voiced
conference was held between the white
men, but it was not until the meal was ended,
Cliff lifting his cup with cramped arm and
hand, Tom feeling his feet prickle as circulation
fed the life fluid to them, Nicky feeling as
though he had been trussed up for years, that
Senor Ortiga delivered the result of the conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We noticed that the tender you came in was
marked from the <i>Senorita</i>,&rdquo; he stated to Tom.
&ldquo;We rowed down the inner channel a way, wondering
how you came to be in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the wreck,&rdquo; added Mr. Coleson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again my dear brother failed to get ahead
of me!&rdquo; snapped the Spaniard, glowering. &ldquo;But
that is aside from the point, which is that we
are through here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll take us back to Jamaica with
you?&rdquo; asked Cliff.</p>
<p>Ortiga shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the tender,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We will
put some food in it and let you use it to get
to wherever you want to go. Do you suppose
we want to get mixed up with the American
Government for tying up its younger citizens?
Not we! But we won&rsquo;t set you adrift or maroon
you. We&rsquo;ll let you have the tender and
some food.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>It was almost half an hour later that Cliff,
Tom and Nicky, seated in the tender, with a
few days&rsquo; supply of canned foods in her bottom,
saw the anchor of <i>El Libertad</i> come up,
heard the pulsing throb of her single, four-cylinder
speed motor, and watched her swing in
a graceful curve into the wide waters of the
Gulf and lay a course Southward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes,&rdquo; said Cliff morosely. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;d better lay to, on some island for the night,
and then start rowing for civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I half wonder if they found the treasure,
after all,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and just acted the way
they did to &lsquo;steer us off&rsquo; and wait till we get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. At least, if they did, I&rsquo;ll bet the treasure
was moved up to a new place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Cliff
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Nicky, &ldquo;I did tell the truth&mdash;the
whole thing and nothing else except the
truth. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned at his chums in the dull light.
&ldquo;I saw your signals, even though I would have
done what I did without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they had suddenly been touched by a &ldquo;live&rdquo;
electric wire the other two could not have
jumped more, or assumed more interested and
amazed expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us what you mean!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nicky, enjoying their suspense,
&ldquo;I told them exactly what Captain Kidd was
reported to have said&mdash;except for one word
that I changed. It didn&rsquo;t change the real meaning,
but I had a sort of flash of something inside,
whatever it was, and I thought maybe if
I changed that one word I could fool them&mdash;lead
them on a false scent, and still tell the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What word was it you changed?&rdquo; cried Tom,
and Cliff echoed the question in slightly different
words but with no less eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat the message!&rdquo; demanded Nicky. Cliff
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the end of the line, in the lowest part
of&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; commanded Nicky. &ldquo;What did you
say after &lsquo;in&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lowest part,&rdquo; replied Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is &lsquo;the lowest part&rsquo; of a dipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom saw it first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bottom!&rdquo; he almost yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; nodded Nicky. &ldquo;The way I remembered
it said &lsquo;in the bottom of the dipper.&rsquo;
So I changed the word to &lsquo;lowest part&rsquo; so I
could make it seem that the two islands at the
lowest part of the sketch were the ones it
meant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was easy to draw the lines,&rdquo; Tom
agreed. &ldquo;Nicky&mdash;I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself for
being angry and for not trusting you!&rdquo; He made
the admission manfully, and extended his hand.
&ldquo;I ask your pardon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to!&rdquo; declared Nicky, but he
grinned to take the sting out of his words.</p>
<p>Cliff was not behind Tom by more than a
sentence. He, too, told his chum how sorry he
was that he did not trust him. Nicky was glad
to grip hands with both and to forget their
former distrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pretend to notice because I wanted
you both to act as though you were mad at
me. It would make them believe I was telling
the truth, I thought,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s row in and see what the real &lsquo;in the
bottom of the Dipper&rsquo; looks like,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly wild to see the real treasure spot,
even if we can&rsquo;t locate anything there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cliff counseled caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows aren&rsquo;t quite out of sight yet,&rdquo;
he declared, &ldquo;and they might be watching. If
we pretend to row along the same way they
are going, until it gets dark, they will believe
we have given up too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good sense,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;When
it&rsquo;s so dark they can&rsquo;t see us, even if they come
back, we can swing in and camp out on some
island. Then, if they get soft-hearted and return
to pick us up, they won&rsquo;t suspect anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>This was agreed to and they rowed along
easily for about an hour. There was no sign,
strain their eyes as they might, that the <i>Libertad</i>
was anywhere else than on the first leg
of her journey to Jamaica, so they pulled to
the shore of an islet that had a small grove of
cocoanut or mangrove trees&mdash;it was too dark to
know which&mdash;and, though their couch was not
very dry and rather too full of matted roots
for comfort, the expectation of the morning&rsquo;s
find, and their own athletic training, enabled
them to make the best of what they had.</p>
<p>Sunrise found Nicky awake and alert. He
shook his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up&mdash;up, daisy, the sun is in the sky!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;and we&mdash;we, daisy, for treasure we shall
try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good sense but terrible poetry!&rdquo;
laughed Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Nicky replied, &ldquo;Tom, cook up
some ham, and a rasher of bacon, and about
twenty eggs and some cocoa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you expect me to get them?&rdquo; demanded
his chum, laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Charge them!&rdquo; Nicky exulted. &ldquo;Charge
them at the nearest store. Our credit ought to
be good. By noon we&rsquo;ll have gold enough to
pay the National Debt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; responded Cliff, &ldquo;gold&mdash;gold&mdash;gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by eight o&rsquo;clock they were in the tender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure bound!&rdquo; Nicky grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DIPPER!</span></span></h2>
<p>First of all, of course, it was necessary for
Tom, Cliff and Nicky to discover the key
islands which formed the Dipper. This was not
easy, because the channels between the islets
were, in many places, too shallow for even their
light-draught boat to navigate.</p>
<p>They had no definite idea just where to locate
the Dipper, except that the charts had
shown it, and the white men had mentioned it
as being about midway between the inner and
the outer boundaries of the archipelago.</p>
<p>Many trials they made before they found a
channel that ran far into the crowded outcroppings
which showed above the shallow water.</p>
<p>Every time they would locate what seemed
to be a straight and a deep waterway, it would
shoal up at one end and they would have to
make a detour, sometimes of several islands,
to find water they could use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; said Nicky, &ldquo;it makes me think
of a day my New York cousins took me for
an automobile ride on Long Island. They were
repairing roads, and every fork or crossroad
we came to, it seemed, they had a sign, &lsquo;Detour!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we &lsquo;detour!&rsquo; again,&rdquo; laughed Cliff,
piloting from the bow, &ldquo;to the left, this time,
Tom&mdash;Nicky&mdash;easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned into a new channel, and so, time
after time, even retracing their course occasionally
to get back to deeper water, they made
slow progress.</p>
<p>No delay daunted them; no shoal &ldquo;made their
pluck run aground,&rdquo; as Nicky explained it. To
the continual detouring was added the handicap
of the difficulty they had in recognizing
what would look like the Dipper constellation
from above. &ldquo;If we had an airplane, now,&rdquo; Tom
argued, &ldquo;we could spy it in a second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, again&mdash;pull slowly,&rdquo; Cliff cut in; and
so the morning wore on and they began to feel
as though they had rowed half way around most
of the archipelago.</p>
<p>But the longest way &rsquo;round is said to be the
shortest way through, and the chums found it
so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Cliff, from the bow, &ldquo;back
water, fellows! And look ahead. I believe we&rsquo;ve
found it!&rdquo; Tom and Nicky swung on the seat
and stared over their shoulders. Hard as it
was to be sure, because other islands, a little
closer or further away complicated the general
pattern, they felt that, at last, they saw the
Dipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s an island almost in line with
two of the lower ones that wasn&rsquo;t on the map,&rdquo;
objected Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Cliff, ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, here&rsquo;s a good channel, and we&rsquo;re
going South again&mdash;back toward where we
started,&rdquo; Nicky argued. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back water! Back water!&rdquo; ordered Cliff.
But they had given a swift impetus to the small
craft as Nicky and Tom bent to the oars and
with a dull grating sound the bow up-ended a
little, as it ran onto a shelf of the bedrock limestone,
into which the coral formed itself.</p>
<p>Tom and Nicky narrowly escaped toppling
over backward and Cliff saved himself from a
plunge onto the shoal only by gripping the
thwart with both hands as the boat stopped
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;here we are!&rdquo; said Nicky, settling
himself. &ldquo;Come aft, Cliff, so we can lighten her
bow and maybe we can pole off and back out&mdash;it&rsquo;s
too narrow a channel to turn around in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff stood up to do as his chum counseled;
but he remained standing, his eyes fixed, his
body becoming tense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;See anything?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<p>Cliff lifted a hand, pointing dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here Nicky&mdash;Tom!&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Easy,
so as not to tip the boat! Do you know what?
That is the Dipper, and we have run aground
right where the line would show we ought to
stop in the chart&mdash;and yonder is &lsquo;the bottom
of the Dipper!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excitedly his fellows scrambled over the intervening
seat and crouched at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I do believe!&rdquo; agreed Nicky.
&ldquo;The reason the line stopped is because the
channel stopped. This is where they must have
come to a standstill in the old boat&mdash;those castaways!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Cliff, &ldquo;they couldn&rsquo;t go any
further. And the bottom is level here. We
could climb out and walk along it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the place to unload chests of treasure,&rdquo;
Tom agreed. &ldquo;If only there was some
place to hide it in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that?&rdquo; cried Nicky, pointing
straight ahead. &ldquo;There on that islet that&rsquo;s
really at the bottom of the Dipper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it said &lsquo;in&rsquo; not &lsquo;at&rsquo; the bottom of the
Dipper,&rdquo; reminded Tom. Nicky nodded, scrambling
out into the shallow water. Cliff followed,
and Tom delayed only long enough to draw the
nose of their tender far enough onto the shelf
of limestone to prevent any chance of a slight
current drifting it out of easy reach while they
walked along carefully on the coral bed, avoiding
jutting prongs and dodging the menacing
little spaces into which a foot could slip so as
to twist an ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the bottom of the Dipper, at least,&rdquo;
Cliff declared after a few minutes of cautious
wading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything to write home about,&rdquo;
Tom said morosely, wincing from the pain of
a slightly twisted foot. &ldquo;All our trouble&mdash;for
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand here a minute,&rdquo; urged Nicky. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
think. Now, fellows, you know that the treasure
wasn&rsquo;t buried yesterday. Maybe the whole
top of the archipelago has changed since the
castaways&rsquo; day. But this looks like the place
they told Captain Kidd about, and unless some
one else has taken it away, their treasure ought
to be here, if we just know how to locate it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; said Cliff, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; called Tom, who had moved
a little beyond his two companions, at the side
of the tiny islet. &ldquo;Some one has been here already!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>They moved up to his position and observed
with dejected eyes the signs of a previous visit
by others; roots were chopped in half; the signs
were very fresh. At one place, very close to
the edge of the small, root-matted surface, a
hole had been chopped completely through the
mass. Further into the brush there were signs
of another such spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; Cliff grumbled. &ldquo;Some one
has beaten us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Cliff,&rdquo; cried Nicky, just behind
his friend. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t step back. Here&rsquo;s another
channel&mdash;right at the bottom of the Dipper part&mdash;it
runs along what is the bottom, between the
islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a hole, maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a channel,&rdquo; persisted Nicky. &ldquo;See&mdash;yonder,
the color of the water looks different
from the shoals. It runs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only goes to the lower island,&rdquo; declared
Tom, studying the water, and gently lowering
himself, testing till his foot found the bottom.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about three feet deep, and&mdash;&rdquo; he
waded carefully away, and then returned. &ldquo;It
stops just by the other island, the South one.
But there&rsquo;s another channel beyond a reef
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then whoever came here didn&rsquo;t use a boat,&rdquo;
Nicky suggested. &ldquo;My guess is that those men
waded up to here yesterday, and dug or
chopped until they were sure they couldn&rsquo;t find
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they didn&rsquo;t come from
where our boat is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Nicky explained, &ldquo;the chopped
places are all on the outside part, nearest the
gully&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t really a boat channel, it&rsquo;s only
a gully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that doesn&rsquo;t help us any,&rdquo; Tom was
still dejected and the more so because of his
slightly injured foot. &ldquo;I move we give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nicky had climbed up onto the low, small
islet, and, his body sprawled over the rooted,
matted growth, was poking and probing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;I guess we
might as well. If there is any treasure, it&rsquo;s too
well hidden to discover. I say we might as
well wade back to the boat and get some lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we had better find our way out before
dark&mdash;it took all morning to get in here,&rdquo; Cliff
suggested. Nicky, as nearly erect as the small,
tough roots under foot would make it safe to
be, began to push and work his way straight
across the islet. Only his head and shoulders
appeared above the low, young growths.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to give up,&rdquo; he said, as his comrades
started to pick their way back along the bed
of the reef. &ldquo;This island may not have been
here at all when the&mdash;&rdquo; His words ceased. There
came a crackling and rending of wood. Nicky
cried out!</p>
<p>Cliff, turning, saw Nicky disappearing!</p>
<p>Forgetting his ankle, with a cry, Tom, who
also swung about, scrambled and plunged toward
Nicky.</p>
<p>The latter was almost out of sight, near the
edge of the islet, prevented from going lower
by two roots, over which he had with quick
presence of mind flung his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I fell&mdash;through!&rdquo; he gasped as his chums
made their way to the edge of the islet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a hole under the roots! Be careful, fellows,
don&rsquo;t slip or break through; the coral may be
thin over it. It may spread further around
than you think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all the caution that their fear for Nicky
permitted his comrades got close. The reef
held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; cried Nicky, breathlessly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
hurt. Fellows&mdash;&rdquo; He made a beckoning motion
with his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;we&rsquo;ve&mdash;found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treasure! I&rsquo;m sure of it. I fell through&mdash;and
I can just touch something&mdash;like bricks&mdash;with
my shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>They had to go around the islet and approach
Nicky from behind. The surface of the thin
coating of land, held up and bound together
only by its interwoven roots, was shaky enough,
but they did not break through, and finally, by
dint of much tugging, heaving and puffing, they
drew Nicky back far enough so that he could
scramble free and sprawl, gasping, half-laughing,
on the surface by the jagged hole he had
just left. Cautiously Cliff protruded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see something!&rdquo; he whispered, as if some
one might hear&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The island wasn&rsquo;t as big or as high,&rdquo; Tom
said, peering too, &ldquo;when the castaways brought
the chests here. They buried them&mdash;they must
have used picks to break a place in the coral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must have covered it over with
boards and pulled the roots and earth over
it&mdash;or else the wind and the birds have brought
seeds and the islet has grown over the place,&rdquo;
Nicky added. &ldquo;The boards were so rotted and
the roots were so weak that my weight broke
through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like three active puppies digging a hole for
bones, the chums pushed and scraped, tugged
and tore at the roots; the weaker ones gave
way and soon they had quite a goodly sized
opening uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something down there!&rdquo; gasped
Cliff. &ldquo;Gold bars, maybe! The chests must
have been thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now the puzzle is&mdash;how can we get close
enough to tell?&rdquo; Nicky said, in an eager voice;
he was none the worse for his experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could one of us make a dive?&rdquo; Tom speculated.
All three were on their knees, heedless
of the sharp coral bits, peering intently through
limpid water into a mysteriously dark depression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could almost touch bottom; where I was,&rdquo;
Nicky exclaimed. &ldquo;Tom, you hold one arm,
Cliff, you brace and hold the other. I&rsquo;ll let
myself down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; came a sharp voice, unexpectedly,
from behind them.</p>
<p>They looked up, startled, dismayed. Quickly
their eyes took in the scene. Just back of their
own tender lay the boat of <i>El Libertad</i>. Quietly
it must have been sculled up, while their attention
was focused on Nicky and his find. Close
behind them, smiling in a half sneering way,
was Mr. Coleson, with Senor Ortiga beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you might have misled us,&rdquo; Mr.
Coleson said. &ldquo;We took the logical step to give
you a free hand, and here you have exercised
it&mdash;for which we are very&mdash;very grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the treasure,&rdquo; added Senor Ortiga,
&ldquo;never mind diving for it. Here comes Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never mind,&rdquo; added Mr. Coleson. &ldquo;We
will attend to it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">GOLD&mdash;GOLD&mdash;GOLD</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do about these lads?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Coleson as the colored man, Jim,
went back to the boat for several spades and
an axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will help&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Senor
Ortiga with a pleasant look that surprised the
chums. &ldquo;Just because they fibbed to us we
can&rsquo;t tie them up again! It was perfectly
natural for them to want all the treasure for
themselves. We felt the same way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did,&rdquo; replied Mr. Coleson. &ldquo;After
we roped them up for a whole day I can&rsquo;t say
that I blame them. Very well. Here is Jim.
Let us clear away the roots and see what we
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the changed attitude of the white men,
Nicky, Tom and Cliff fell to with a will. The
axe helped, the spades were very useful; eager
hands made the work seem a delight. After all,
there would be probably be plenty of gold&mdash;or
whatever it might be&mdash;for each to have a good
share.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>When they had cleared away a good portion
of the earth and the matted undergrowth clinging
to the crumbly soil, they saw, as soon as
the mud they had created was settled, a fairly
wide, and not very deep fissure in the coral beneath.</p>
<p>Probably, they decided, the castaways, in the
days they had been there, had taken advantage
of a naturally formed depression in the limestone
formation, perhaps had widened it somewhat
with picks.</p>
<p>At any rate, when the moiled water had
cleared, they beheld a mass of metallic bars,
thrown in, helter-skelter.</p>
<p>Mr. Coleson, being the tallest, lowered himself
onto the top of the mass and found that
his chin was just above water. By taking a
deep breath, holding it, and plunging, naked as
he was, beneath the surface, he could get down,
for a brief time to the hoard of metal.</p>
<p>After his first plunge he came up, and sputtering
till he rid his nostrils of water, he held
up above the water a bar, which Senor Ortiga
almost snatched from him in his excitement.</p>
<p>They all crowded around to look.</p>
<p>Ortiga scraped the dirt and slime, accumulated
partly from their recent digging, from the
bar and gave an exultant cry.</p>
<p>One and all they echoed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gold&mdash;gold&mdash;gold!&rdquo; shrilled Nicky.</p>
<p>Down again plunged Mr. Coleson, to emerge
above the surface with a second bar which was
eagerly grasped by Tom. It weighed, he
guessed, about ten pounds, and was, when examined,
what appeared to be pure gold of very
fine quality, not very large, for gold is heavy
metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spaniards used to melt down the Inca
images and ornaments,&rdquo; Cliff recalled. &ldquo;Then
they would ship them to Spain in galleons.
There must be a lot of this gold&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there,
Mr. Coleson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a lot!&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>All resentment vanished from the hearts of
these strangely united enemies under the impulse
of a common gold madness. Mr. Coleson
dived under, several times, bringing up bars
similar to those already found. Then it was
decided that they had better take what they
had, go to the <i>Libertad</i>, and wait till daylight
for full boatloads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have been lost in these islands&mdash;among
the twisting, blind channels,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Coleson. &ldquo;We laid down markers on the
islands as we came in, each time, and we had
better row out before it gets too dark to see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>So they all returned to <i>El Libertad</i> and spent
an excited evening, hardly daring to sleep for
fear they would wake up to discover that their
treasure was only dream-gold. But it was solid,
in the morning light, gleaming with its yellow
luster when they scraped the surface. They
had found a treasure for which men might
easily struggle and battle, kill and be killed.</p>
<p>The next few days were full of hard work;
nevertheless, it was work that brought no complaints.</p>
<p>The recovery of the golden bars was necessarily
somewhat slow because only one man
could work in the pit at a time. Mr. Coleson,
Jim and Senor Ortiga took turns, but most of
the diving fell to Mr. Coleson, for as they
brought up more bars the level of the bottom
fell lower by their removal, and the shorter
people were totally under water when they
tried to secure the bars, and had to dive, grab
a bar, thrust themselves upward and be caught
by those who waited.</p>
<p>But, one late afternoon they had exhausted
the contents of the hole as far as gold was concerned.
There were several large objects, presumably
golden placques or perhaps they were
silver; but they were too heavy to be dislodged,
much less to be lifted to the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>All of the company agreed that it was hardly
worth while to try for them any longer, and
the white men, with Jim, began to pick their
way over to the two boats, both filled with
their last load of wealth. But Nicky motioned
to his chums to delay for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Coleson had a despatch box of some
kind almost at the surface, just a little while
ago,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a try to get
it again. He dropped it because he said it probably
contained only papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we want with papers?&rdquo; argued
Tom. &ldquo;We can come back some time and get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have the log of the old ship in it,
or papers about the cruise,&rdquo; Nicky argued.
&ldquo;Cliff&rsquo;s father would like them more, I think,
than the gold. He could write a whole history
about the Spanish times in America from them,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff, being the oldest and strongest, decided
to do the diving. Divesting himself of clothing
which he hung on the remaining bushes on
the rim of the islet they had not disturbed, he
plunged.</p>
<p>On his first rise he clutched an ancient ornament,
something like part of a figure of a god,
but it was of some stone, not of gold; he was
about to throw it aside but Nicky took it. &ldquo;It
might be a relic, like those we found in the
Carib diggings,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Cliff made several tries, and finally brought
up an old, and very much rusted bronze box,
of very curious workmanship, with a handle at
each end. It was badly eaten away by oxide
and Cliff urged Tom, who took it, to handle it
with care. Then Cliff was helped up onto the
water-covered bedrock and reached for his
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky, turning toward the boats,
gasped. &ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re putting gold from our boat into
theirs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Tom made the exclamation he started
toward the distant boats; the two white men
and the colored Jim were loading up their boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>He, as well as his slightly injured foot would
allow, hastened over the coral. Cliff, his clothes
carried in a rough, quickly snatched bundle, ran
too. Nicky scrambled ahead of him.</p>
<p>But before they could get to the boats they
saw Jim take the oars out of their boat, climb
into his own, and thrust it rapidly backward&mdash;there
was no depth to turn it around&mdash;down
the channel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave these oars on the island at the
bend,&rdquo; called Senor Ortiga. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
to leave you here to starve. Swim down or
push your boat ahead of you and swim till you
get the oars; then follow the markers; we&rsquo;ll
leave them, too. We don&rsquo;t want to desert you,
but we must. By the time you get out we can
be safely away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky and Cliff fought their way over the
coral as fast as they could, stumbling into crevasses,
almost falling as their incautious feet
struck rises; but they saw that it was wasted
effort.</p>
<p>They returned, to assist Tom.</p>
<p>Once the three were in their boat, far down
the channel they saw the other boat turn and
disappear around a bend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be dark, before we get there,&rdquo; cried
Tom, and he began to shudder and to forecast
dire difficulties, but Cliff bade him, rather
sharply, to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember what the teacher said, last term,
about being afraid?&rdquo; Nicky reminded Tom.
&ldquo;He said that when we became afraid we deadened
our common sense and made pictures of
dangers that wouldn&rsquo;t exist at all unless we
thought they did. He said it wasn&rsquo;t what was
dangerous that hurts us, but what we thought
might happen. So&mdash;Tom&mdash;snap out of it!&rdquo; He
spoke rather curtly and slangily, to impress
Tom the more quickly. Tom saw the sense in
the rebuke and reminder and grinned sheepishly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Meanwhile, a hand on the stern thwart, Cliff
was thrusting with his feet, swimming, and
pushing the boat ahead at a slow rate.</p>
<p>They finally reached the distant island and
found the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we better stay here till daylight?&rdquo; questioned
Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nicky declared. &ldquo;They have our gold,
and they mustn&rsquo;t get away. They have a heavy
load and they may get stuck in the channel for
their greediness. We can see the papers they
stuck on sticks to mark the channel. Let&rsquo;s get
on as far as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom agreed with him, not especially caring
to stay amid the spooky, silent islets all night.</p>
<p>They had hard work in the swiftly closing
darkness, but by using their eyes sharply and
by going ahead slowly, as their escaping enemies
must also do, they finally saw clear water
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;I think I see them
still in the rowboat! Pull hard, Cliff and Tom,
we can get there before they get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as he said it there came a hail, sharp and
eager from the shore of the island at the mouth
of the channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Cliff held their oars, surprised, listening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boat ahoy! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s on that island!&rdquo; Nicky declared.
Mechanically responding to a call for aid, Tom
and Cliff swung the tender&rsquo;s nose toward the
island. Their way took them very close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys&mdash;Master Cliff&mdash;Master Tom&mdash;Master
Nicky! It&rsquo;s Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure they could discern against the
trees waved its arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, pull in close,&rdquo; cried the tall figure,
wading into the water to meet them. &ldquo;My
boat&rsquo;s gone. Take me in. We can git to the
other boat before they get away! Hurry, please,
sars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only an instant before he had caught
the approaching gunwale and was tumbling in.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;give way, sars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; cried Nicky, at the bow, pumping
the black hand. &ldquo;I never was so glad to see
anybody in my life. Grab those oars! We&rsquo;ll
get them yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they were fated to act otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">MAROONED</span></span></h2>
<p>After a quick handclasp with the other two,
Sam counseled delay. &ldquo;Better to tell me what
has happened to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are men
hiding on that ship, waiting till the men in the
boat get all their dunnage on board&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunnage!&rdquo; interrupted Nicky. &ldquo;Sam&mdash;it&rsquo;s
gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s eyes rolled with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went and found it!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did, and they took it away from us,&rdquo;
Tom explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hiding?&rdquo; Cliff asked.</p>
<p>Sam suggested that they had better tell him
their story first, and he laid on the oars and
listened as they gave him a brief history of
their adventures.</p>
<p>In his turn he told them his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I got my head full of crazy scares,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I left you on Crocodile Key, and
sailed for the open water. Later on a revenue
cutter overhauled me. Mr. Neale was with the
men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was all right?&rdquo; Nicky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sam replied, &ldquo;all right, and mad.
When he found out what I&rsquo;d went and done he
gave me an awful talking to, and then they
turned the cutter about and went back to look
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, Sam explained, his conscience
bothered him, but he decided that the boys must
be all right, and so held on his course toward
Jamaica. But during the late afternoon clouds
gathered, wind came up, rain squalls blew over
and his work was cut out for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judged it was a &lsquo;judgment&rsquo; on me from
On High,&rdquo; Sam declared. &ldquo;I had more&rsquo;n I could
do, handling the sails to get them down, and all
I could do I couldn&rsquo;t get them reefed quick
enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you lost your boat?&rdquo; broke in Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sar,&rdquo; Sam replied. &ldquo;Wait&mdash;let me tell
you. I had to run before the wind and when
daylight came and the wind dropped I was so
wore out with a sight at the tiller that I just
fell down and slept. I let the <i>Treasure Belle</i>
drift.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>When he had awakened, he went on, he did
not know where he was, but from the direction
in which the wind had blown, he guessed that
he must be well into the Gulf of Mexico. He
trimmed his sails and with the old, heavy-duty
engine for a kicker, he set a course Eastward.
It brought him, in time, within sight of what
he discovered to be the lower end of the Ten
Thousand Island archipelago, almost opposite
to the wrecked <i>Senorita</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw somebody making a signal with a flag,
and the flag at the masthead was upside down&mdash;a
sign of distress,&rdquo; Sam pursued his story, &ldquo;I
ran close in and found out that the <i>Senorita</i>
was a wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were on it when it happened&mdash;but we
told you. Go on,&rdquo; said Tom. Sam finished
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a colored cook, a Spaniard, a
man named Tew, and some sailors and the engineer,&rdquo;
Sam concluded. &ldquo;They offered me money
to take them aboard the <i>Treasure Belle</i>. I did,
but instead of going back around Cape Sable,
they took me and tied me up and threw me in
the little cabin. They talked about capturing
a boat or something and the first thing I knew,
they had passed the <i>Libertad</i>, here, and went
on beyond during the night. That was at night&mdash;last
night. They hauled the <i>Treasure Belle</i>
out of sight between two islands, a little North
of here. There they laid quiet all today. One
man swam off from my sloop and came back
and they all talked. Towards evening they
started the engine, came down, hauled alongside
and got on board the <i>Libertad</i>. They had
untied me and told me to swim onto one of the
islands and stay&mdash;or starve, for all they cared.
Then they held guns on me until I swam to
the Key. They said if I warned anybody I saw,
they&rsquo;d pepper me full of lead. So I hid, and
when I saw two white men and a Negro rowing
towards <i>Libertad</i>, I didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything.
But nothing happened to them, and
when I saw your boat I guessed it was safe
to hail, because the men on the <i>Libertad</i> must
be hiding and couldn&rsquo;t hurt me. And so I
found you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right sorry sars, for what I done, and
I&rsquo;ll try to make it up to you,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Nicky stated. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
hold it against you. But you didn&rsquo;t say what
happened to your sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They put two sailors into her and sailed her
away down the coast,&rdquo; Sam replied. &ldquo;To tell
somebody something about bringing up some
cases or something like that. I couldn&rsquo;t hear
much. They talked about lots of things&mdash;Indians
and sharks and&mdash;oh, lots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t we row to the <i>Libertad</i>?&rdquo;
demanded Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>As he spoke the reason became apparent.
Jim, in the boat, handed up onto the deck to
the white men the last bars of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aboard,&rdquo; was presumably his order;
the chums and Sam were too far away to hear.
They did see sudden flashes, hear a subdued
commotion, hear splashes in the water. Guns
were being fired, and people were shouting.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, before the shots died
down, in fact, they heard the roar of <i>El Libertad&rsquo;s</i>
motor, saw her swing to her anchor, and,
as it lifted from the coral, turned in a wide
sweep, while shots flashed their spurts of flame
through the darkness from her stern.</p>
<p>Then she swung onto a Northerly course and
disappeared swiftly beyond an island at the
Northern side of the channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shot those men who took our gold,&rdquo;
Nicky declared. &ldquo;Sam, and Cliff, row there,
quick! We ought to try to pick them up&mdash;maybe
they&rsquo;re badly hurt.&rdquo; Sam and Tom dipped
their oars with a will.</p>
<p>Cliff having donned his clothes, of course,
before he took the oars as they rowed out from
the treasure islet, took the tender&rsquo;s light tiller
from the floor where it lay while they navigated
the shoal water, shipped it and its attached
rudder, and steered so that the rowers could
put more force into their strokes and thus cover
the water more quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>They soon reached the spot, and saw several
figures struggling with a third.</p>
<p>Sam and Nicky hailed. An answer came,
&ldquo;Jim, here, was knocked overside when he tried
to scramble onto our ship. Help us get him to
shore. His head hit the coral, we think! They
sank the rowboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pulled close and with some difficulty the
inert colored man was lifted over the gunwale
and dropped into the tender&rsquo;s bottom. Then
Mr. Coleson, with a smarting flesh wound in
his arm, and Ortiga, who was too busy expressing
an unfavorable opinion of his renegade
brother to examine his hurts, seemed to have
escaped with a scratched hand.</p>
<p>They began to row toward the island but
Nicky made a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pull for the wrecked <i>Senorita</i>,&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s most likely to be a medicine
kit on board her, and food as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took quite a while to get back down the
shore line to the point almost opposite the
Shark River where the <i>Senorita</i> had grounded;
but when they got there Nicky&rsquo;s prophecy
proved to be correct and Senor Ortiga, when
the surgical and medicinal appliances were
brought, made an examination of Jim, and then
dressed a rather bad scalp wound, bringing its
edges together with surgical thread after washing
it with antiseptics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Jim came to himself before the bandaging
was completed. Though weak and a little bit
uncertain in speech, he was in no way permanently
injured in his brain. Rest would restore
his usual vigor and help nature to heal his hurt.</p>
<p>Weary and discouraged, because there was
nothing to be done toward the recovery of their
lost treasure, the chums, after a midnight meal,
threw themselves onto bunks in the engine
room, preferring these to more comfortable
wall berths with the two white men who had
done them so mean a turn.</p>
<p>Sam elected to stay with his own companions,
and Jim was put in the forecastle to be alone
while he rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am grateful to you for saving
us, just now,&rdquo; said Mr. Coleson as they separated
for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the way he acted, he ought to be,&rdquo;
Nicky confided to his comrades, when they were
alone.</p>
<p>They slept peacefully, thoroughly wearied by
hard work and worn down by the nerve tension
of the last few days.</p>
<p>It was Sam who shook them awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man, Coleson, wasn&rsquo;t so grateful, after
all,&rdquo; he said when the chums had rubbed some
sleep out of their eyes in the early dawn. &ldquo;The
tender is gone. The two white men&mdash;gone too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ungrateful&mdash;&rdquo; began Nicky. But what
would calling names do for them? Certainly it
wouldn&rsquo;t help any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not on an island, and we&rsquo;ve got
food,&rdquo; Nicky observed, recovering his usual
trust in the eventual justice of life. &ldquo;But we are
marooned! And yet&mdash;and yet, I&rsquo;ll say it again&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
come out best in the long run. You
wait and see!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">&ldquo;A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK&rdquo;</span></span></h2>
<p>To say that Clarence Neale, the leader at the
start of the Mystery Boys&rsquo; adventure, was
worried would be a tame statement of the
truth. Clarence Neale was more than that. He
felt that without intending to do so he had
shirked a responsibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray, the scholar and writer, had entrusted
Cliff to his care on an adventure that
promised to be merely a cruise; Nicky Lane,
and Tom, had come under his protection without
permission from their relatives; and not
one of them was with him, nor was their whereabouts
known to him.</p>
<p>No wonder the young archaeologist, himself
not too far from boyhood to recall what dangers
its headstrong impulses lead to, dreaded many
dire things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Two things he knew definitely. The boys
were not on Crocodile Key, nor did any boatman
or native in Little Card Sound or on its
shores know a thing about them. The second
point he was sure about was that they were
not on Sam&rsquo;s sloop. He had overhauled that
in the government cutter and made sure.</p>
<p>Where were they?</p>
<p>A lieutenant in charge of the patrol had set
him ashore where a government sub-station of
the patrol service enabled him to use the telephone,
to communicate with other stations. Not
a sign of the boys resulted from his several
calls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No word?&rdquo; asked the young lieutenant later
in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Neale shook his head dejectedly, climbing
aboard the cutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything to explain it except
that the lads must have gone inland, and become
lost,&rdquo; he asserted. Lieutenant Sommerlee
discounted such a suggestion. The outcrop
of coral on which they landed while he went to
interview Nelse and Pompey, was cut off by
water too deep to wade; they would hardly
dare swim to the further shore; it was swampy
as could be seen from Crocodile Key if they
took pains to look, he declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest that you come aboard again,&rdquo;
Lieutenant Sommerlee invited, holding to his
own idea, without stating it, that the boys had
been taken off the key by some fisherman. &ldquo;I
have word that a band of hi-jackers is somewhere
around and I have to watch for them;
we can easily hail the different natives as we
pass up and down the coast and see which one
rescued the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarence Neale accepted the invitation and
was on board the cutter when, that night, she
pursued, and lost touch with, the <i>Senorita</i>.</p>
<p>It was Lieutenant Sommerlee&rsquo;s notion that
the <i>Senorita</i>, if it was she, had turned tail and
run for her home port in Cuba. He was ready
to give up the search for her, and the more so
because of a growing intensity of interest in
the boys.</p>
<p>Naturally, not knowing they were on the
<i>Senorita</i>, or that she had gone into the archipelago,
neither Mr. Neale nor the lieutenant
thought of such a thing as looking for the adventuresome
trio in those waters. It seemed
almost certain that they must have hailed some
small boat, and on being taken aboard, had
found no means of communicating their plight,
or of getting back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>But as day followed day, the idea had to be
given up. There was no spot that the cutter
had not touched, where the boys could possibly
be. Unless they had been taken off on a coasting
sloop&mdash;but none had been seen in Little
Card Sound, nor would it have excuse for being
there. Of course the few who knew the truth
about the <i>Senorita</i> and her hiding place on the
day that the boys had been missed, kept their
mouths tightly closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine what has become of them,&rdquo;
Mr. Neale said, with anxiety in his voice and
deep wrinkles of worry on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll turn up, as boys do, and usually
safe and sound,&rdquo; the lieutenant said.</p>
<p>One of their men sighted a sail and gave her
position. Lieutenant Sommerlee gave orders;
the helm was shifted and a course was laid to
intercept the vessel, not because the boys might
be on it, but to hail it and see if any news had
been picked up somewhere.</p>
<p>As they came within better sighting distance,
Lieutenant Sommerlee handed Mr. Neale his
binoculars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say Sam&rsquo;s sloop we overhauled
was going back to Jamaica?&rdquo; he asked. Clarence
Neale nodded. &ldquo;I told Sam he was discharged,
as far as our party was concerned,&rdquo;
he acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; ordered the lieutenant. Mr. Neale
lifted and focused the glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great&mdash;guns!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <i>Treasure
Belle</i>, now, as sure as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lost no time in laying alongside and
hailing.</p>
<p>But Sam did not answer. Instead one of two
men spoke through the deepening twilight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sam&mdash;why he&rsquo;s sick in the cabin. We&rsquo;re
taking him to a doctor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam&mdash;sick,&rdquo; Mr. Neale said to the cutter&rsquo;s
officer, &ldquo;but we left him on the way to Jamaica
the afternoon before the squall. How did these
men get on his boat?&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are they bound Eastward along
the coast when he ought to be nearly to Jamaica
by now&mdash;here, heave to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sail came down with a run&mdash;the men
were careless sloopmen or very ignorant of a
single-masted boat and her handling. The cutter
swung in a circle and ranged up beside the
sloop.</p>
<p>It was practically dark, for the twilight is
short in the season, and the men sat with their
heads well covered. But if this was a ruse
to escape detection of their identity it failed.
Lieutenant Sommerlee motioned to a patrol
member, and the man caught the rail of the
<i>Treasure Belle</i> and clung so that the boats lay
sides-to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>The lieutenant stepped across the rails, and
made his way to the cabin. At the same instant
the two men stood up, but before they could
carry out their intention&mdash;which might have
been to plunge over the side and take chances
of swimming away and escaping in the dark&mdash;the
young officer had his pistol trained, drawing
it as he whirled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw up your hands!&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;and
sit down again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; called Mr. Neale, clambering into the
cockpit of his old sloop, &ldquo;where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no one there,&rdquo; said one of the men.
&ldquo;Lieutenant, will you promise us a fair break
if we tell you the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow-livered, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
guessed you would try that.&rdquo; He went close,
called for a flashlight and trained it on the
two anxious sailors. &ldquo;Ho! You&mdash;&lsquo;Runty&rsquo;&mdash;you,
too&mdash;&lsquo;Jack O&rsquo; the Keys.&rsquo; What are you
doing in this sloop? Where is Sam&mdash;but I may
as well tell you that you are under arrest right
now, and if you expect any leniency, which I
won&rsquo;t promise at this moment, you had better
say what&rsquo;s on your minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they told him. He, and Clarence Neale,
learned of the escape of the <i>Senorita</i>, as well
as of Nelse&rsquo;s part in that, and in the hi-jacker&rsquo;s
plans, in which Nelse figured as a receiver for
their stolen cargoes, since he owned Crocodile
Key; they also learned of the wreck, of the
boys&rsquo; ruse, and escape, and of the latest escapade,
as far as the men knew it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Full speed for the archipelago, was the
present order, after the two sailors had been
handcuffed and two of the cutter&rsquo;s crew took
over the <i>Treasure Belle</i>, to sail her to the
patrol base until Sam could claim her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though there&rsquo;s a fire up yonder,&rdquo;
said Lieutenant Sommerlee, as the cutter
doubled the Westermost nose of Florida, &ldquo;See
the light in the sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the boys aren&rsquo;t in any danger!&rdquo; cried
Clarence Neale.</p>
<p>None of the crew, neither Mr. Neale, the
lieutenant, nor Uncle Sam&rsquo;s sailors, could resist
a cheer of delight when they got close
enough to see that the fire was merely a great
heap of wood, on a small islet near the channel
to Shark River.</p>
<p>They sent up a rocket at the first verification
of this fact, and urged their speedy engine to
its fullest power as rockets began to burst in the
sky, blue, green and red flares showed and a
dull boom from a signaling cannon floated
across the water to them.</p>
<p>It seemed an age, but was not so very long,
before the chums were leaping, skylarking, dancing,
standing on their heads, slapping one
another on the back, adding a slap or so for
delighted Sam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>They had collected wood, cut parts from the
wrecked vessel, made a signal fire on the islet,
and kept it burning all day, and into the night,
since the discovery that they were marooned,
that morning. The purpose was to create a
smoke smudge during the day, and a light at
night, with the certainty that some coasting
vessel or other ship must see it and come closer
to investigate.</p>
<p>The rockets and colored flares were the signal
stores of the <i>Senorita</i>, used more as fireworks
for the celebration than with any other
purpose, for the signal rocket of the cutter had
been read by Sam as the patrol&rsquo;s own signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven you boys are safe!&rdquo; cried
Mr. Neale for the tenth time, pumping Nicky&rsquo;s
hand again and again, sharing fist-cuffs impartially
between the shoulderblades of Cliff
and Tom in his elation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thank Lieutenant Sommerlee too,&rdquo; said
Cliff. They did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said Nicky, soberly, &ldquo;what to do
about the gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had, of course, told all their adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you are all right,&rdquo; Lieutenant
Sommerlee said, &ldquo;I feel that we shall have to
let the gold wait. What I am interested in is
not gold but&mdash;hi-jackers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pirates,&rdquo; added Cliff. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget
they are in a stolen boat&mdash;the <i>Libertad</i> belongs
to one Ortiga, and the other one has it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Lieutenant,&rdquo; protested Nicky, &ldquo;if you
get the hi-jackers we&rsquo;ll get the gold. They have
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed the officer. &ldquo;At the
moment I am puzzled about the course through
which we can secure either men or gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky jumped up eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the <i>Senorita</i> was running away,&rdquo; he
reminded his chums, &ldquo;remember that Tew told
us they would hide up in Shark River?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; agreed Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sam, when they took his sloop, thought
the men said something to the two on her about
bringing liquor cases or cases of liquor, and
something was said about sharks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; Sam exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;ve gone into Shark River&mdash;&rdquo;
Nicky declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are at the mouth of the channel into
Shark River,&rdquo; objected Tom. &ldquo;And they captured
the <i>Libertad</i> North of this place, and
turned North again from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have doubled back; Nicky defended
his idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is a more likely solution,&rdquo;
suggested the lieutenant. &ldquo;They went to the
channel at the opening of the Harney River,
above; there they could go back into the inner
channel&mdash;above Whitewater Bay, and down
that, again, to the landward entry into the
Shark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plans were discussed, ideas proposed, until
far into the night. In all that the chums proposed,
they figured; in those their elders discussed,
they did not.</p>
<p>But because of the crew&rsquo;s depletion by the
departure on the sloop of two of her fighting
patrols, and because neither Sam nor Mr. Neale
was an expert with a rifle or pistol, the more
vigorous plans for pursuit and capture had to
be shelved in favor of more adroit measures.</p>
<p>And so it came about that a plan partially
suggested by Nicky and elaborated by the lieutenant,
in which the boys must figure, was the
one to be adopted.</p>
<p>And again the Mystery Boys were adventure
bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Cliff, as a new thought struck
him, &ldquo;those hi-jackers must have seen our lights&mdash;we
made plenty of excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;They may have seen
them&mdash;then, they will either turn and run
across the Gulf, or somewhere else, or they
will unload the treasure in Shark River and
hide it in the Everglades.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once it&rsquo;s hidden there, any effort to find
it would be like looking for a needle in a hay-stack!&rdquo;
declared Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo; cried Nicky, and from
that instant all was activity on the stranded
<i>Senorita</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">IN THE EVERGLADES</span></span></h2>
<p>In order to see how Nicky&rsquo;s plan was, the
picture that he had in his mind must be understood.
This was Nicky&rsquo;s mind picture:</p>
<p>The hi-jackers, after capturing Sam&rsquo;s sloop,
had sent her, with two men aboard, to make
contact with their Little Card Sound headquarters.
Nelse was there and from what he
had heard and pieced together, Nicky supposed
that the two men on the <i>Treasure Belle</i> would
find Nelse, and have him go, or send Seminole
Indians, across the inland waterways, to take
to the hi-jackers some liquor cases in which to
conceal the treasure bars.</p>
<p>When they captured the <i>Libertad</i>, the hi-jackers
had left three men floundering in the
water; for all they knew or cared, these men
might have been wounded. The <i>Libertad&rsquo;s</i> own
boat had been sunk by bullet holes during the
fight, which was why the boys had been left
without a boat when Senor Ortiga and Mr.
Coleson had fled the <i>Senorita</i> in the tender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Under such conditions the hi-jackers had
started North in <i>El Libertad</i>, the night previous
to that on which the cutter arrived.</p>
<p>They would hardly go to the shores of the
Southern States bordering the Gulf of Mexico,
Nicky decided, because they would be afraid
of having the gold discovered: it was in bars
and had been loaded into the <i>Libertad</i> without
any provision for its concealment and transportation
later on.</p>
<p>The hi-jackers would probably go, Nicky
argued, into the inner channel of the archipelago
and then lay up in the Shark River, that
small stream having its source at the edge of
the Everglades. It was the most Southerly
place they could get close to the Everglades,
and the Seminoles, bringing the cases to put
the treasure in would come up the inland way
through part of Big Cypress Swamp, along the
rim of the Everglades, and meet them. That
was the only way Nicky could see for the hi-jackers
to do, because they had no small boat
and could not go any closer to the shallow
water of the Florida swamp than the draught
of <i>El Libertad</i> would permit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>They could not have had enough gasoline in
the tanks to risk a very long voyage; that was
the reason he did not think they would try to
get to the Southern States and risk themselves
in strange waters with no way to carry the
gold from the vessel to their Northern headquarters,
wherever that might be.</p>
<p>With all of this the older heads of the party
agreed.</p>
<p>Their first plan, then, was to get the <i>Libertad</i>
pocketed and surrounded; this they must do
before the treasure could be hidden.</p>
<p>Without a small boat it was not probable
that the hi-jackers could get into the Everglades,
but they might know the Seminoles and
might be able to get hold of a canoe.</p>
<p>A day, and a good part of the night before
had passed since they went away in the <i>Libertad</i>,
but Lieutenant Sommerlee and Mr. Neale
decided that they had probably gone into the
Shark River and laid up. They had no reason
to be afraid: they left the <i>Libertad&rsquo;s</i> owners
in the water; they left three boys and a Negro
in another rowboat. There was not much
danger, from their way of looking at it, in
anything that these people could do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>If they had seen the signal smoke of the day
or the fire and the rockets and lights at night,
it would be too late for them to run out in the
<i>Libertad</i>; and, unless they had already hidden
the treasure, they could not very easily do so
in the darkness. They would be more apt to
believe themselves well hidden, and would not
make any move before daylight, because they
would be waiting for their two men in the sloop
to get Southeast and bring help from inland.
They did not know, of course, that the men
had been captured.</p>
<p>First of all, Sam and a patrol sailor went
over the side of the <i>Senorita</i>, in the dark, with
ropes under their arms and fastened to the
rail. They searched about on the reef at the
side of the ship where Nicky and his chums had
thrown the rifles and pistols. Lieutenant Sommerlee
did not think that these had been in the
water long enough to be severely damaged or
made useless; he wanted them for a purpose.</p>
<p>Sam and his companion by dint of much
searching brought up both submerged rifles and
several pistols.</p>
<p>They were set to work cleaning and drying
and oiling them at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliff,&rdquo; ordered Lieutenant Sommerlee, taking
command, &ldquo;you&mdash;with Sam and Jim and
one of my sailors, will stay on the <i>Senorita</i>.
Jim has had a night and a day to rest in and
he is pretty strong again. You four are the
guardians of this Shark River channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they try to run out past us we must try
to prevent that,&rdquo; Cliff agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the commander. &ldquo;My boatswain,
Jack, will be with you and, for the sake
of discipline, you must all obey his orders. He
has a cool head and is a fine shot. Four of you
ought to be able to block this channel if the
hi-jackers try to run out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; agreed Cliff, feeling the importance
of his share in the blockade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of us will start at once in the cutter,&rdquo;
the lieutenant continued. &ldquo;We will tow
our own light dory, and when we reach the
inner mouth of the Harney River, Mr. Neale,
Nicky, and one of my men who has been into
the Everglades, will drop off in the dory and
go up the Harney River as fast as they can by
night. By submerging a flashlight in the water,
training its beam on the bottom, and rowing
carefully they can get almost to the head of
the stream, where it has its source at the rim
of the Everglades. From there, as soon as
dawn comes, my man will direct the course
South along the rim of the Everglades to the
nearest point he sees fit to the Shark River.
The Harney starts a few miles North of the
Shark, at the rimrock, and by sending the boat
there, we can block the Everglades side and
stop any Indians who may come there from
Big Cypress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will stop them, never fear!&rdquo; declared
Nicky stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you will,&rdquo; said the lieutenant
with a smile. &ldquo;The cutter will proceed carefully
down the inner channel. I will be in command,
and will lie-to close to the bank, not far
from the Shark. Unless the hi-jackers rush out
I will do nothing until we are all in position.
We shall need some signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any smoke-rockets on the cutter?&rdquo;
asked Nicky. &ldquo;They would make enough light
to be seen at night, and smoke to see by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have,&rdquo; answered a sailor. &ldquo;Plenty of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will take four,&rdquo; Nicky suggested.
&ldquo;How will we use them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One at night will call for help. One right
after the other at night will call urgently for
help. Do not use them for any other purpose
tonight, and I will be watching the sky over
the &rsquo;Glades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; said Nicky in proper nautical
deference. &ldquo;Then, when we get into place at
the inside end of the Shark, shall we signal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant. &ldquo;But if you
see that there is no boat in the Shark River at
all, send up a rocket, wait a minute and then
send up a second. Watch for the same signal
in reply; if you do not get it, repeat with your
other two rockets. If the boat is there, make
no signal unless the men are escaping. In that
case, send up three rockets in quick succession,
as fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we be able to set them up?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find clumps of tall saw-grass
almost everywhere; it is from four to eight or
nine feet high, and you must be careful not to
let its sharp edges gash you, but it is strong
enough to support a rocket in an upright position
while you set and light it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hasty repetition by each member of the
party of plans in which they must participate,
the arranging of signals from the cutter, and
of others from the <i>Senorita</i>, completed the arrangements.</p>
<p>Cliff, with Jim, Sam and the boatswain, Jack,
busily getting the recovered arsenal into good
shape again, saw the cutter disappear into the
gloom.</p>
<p>The run up the channel into the Harney
River was without event, and since Lieutenant
Sommerlee had cruised in those waters, making
a chart for the U. S. Geodetic Survey, he knew
the safest way, and finally, with tense, thrilling
nerves, Nicky dropped into the light dory with
Mr. Neale and a sailor called Brownie because
his last name was Brown and he was a short,
fat, jolly little man. With whispered directions
from the cutter&rsquo;s commander, they pushed off
and with Mr. Neale at the oars and Nicky in
the stem, Brownie being at the bow to give the
course up the rapidly narrowing stream, they
slipped into a darkness that seemed to close
down about them like a curtain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>By following the lieutenant&rsquo;s directions they
made steady progress as far as their boat dared
go in the dark, feeling-out the channel with the
tip of their flashlight under water so they could
see the coral bottom of the river. Finally they
stopped, tied to a heavy root and got such sleep
as they could, curled up on their hard seats.</p>
<p>At about four-thirty, before dawn cut
through the heavy tangle of trees, intertwined
overhead, Brownie awoke his companions and
they ate their hardtack, and picked the bones
of a chicken from the cutter&rsquo;s recent purchases,
cooked the night before on the <i>Senorita</i>; this
they washed down with cocoa from tin cups,
cocoa hot out of a thermos bottle.</p>
<p>The hot liquid helped to drive away the night
chill, and Nicky declared that he felt fit for
anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; chuckled Brownie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to have to stand in shallow water and
walk in it, too. We must drag our dory up
over the rock bed here at the rim of the Everglades.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>In spite of the cold of the water, fed by the
overflow from the Everglades which, themselves,
are renewed by many streams that spout
out cold and clear, from holes in the limestone,
they dragged and tugged and laughed softly as
they slipped, until, when the dory was over the
rim, and into fairly good water, they were quite
warm from their exertions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; said Brownie softly, with a
wave of his hand. &ldquo;Here we are&mdash;in the Everglades!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">NICKY DOES SOME SCOUTING</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;While we rest,&rdquo; Brownie said to Nicky,
&ldquo;take a good look around. There&rsquo;s not so
many white boys who get to see the Everglades.
It&rsquo;s a sight worth seeing, just at daybreak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was. Nicky stared about, and turned in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought,&rdquo; he said, amazed. &ldquo;I
thought the &rsquo;Glades were all swamps. They&rsquo;re
not, at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a one has the wrong idea,&rdquo; retorted
Brownie affably. &ldquo;In truth, the &rsquo;Glades are
just flat bedrock, mostly, under a couple of feet
of water, and with a very thin soil that the
grass hangs onto. Down South&rsquo;ard, you see,
where the trees are, that&rsquo;s Big Cypress. That&rsquo;s
all swamp, I admit, and bad to get into. This
would be as bad if you got lost in it, and that
wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard, would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Neale agreed with him, while Nicky,
standing upright on the forward thwart, forgot
his wet feet in the beauty and strangeness of
the scene before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>At the Eastern edge of the &rsquo;Glades, the sun
was rising, casting its slanting, golden rays
across a great expanse of grass, and more
grass, and yet more grass.</p>
<p>That grass was no such growth as is usually
understood by the name. It was tall, some
clumps of it reaching up as high as ten feet.
There were several kinds, but most predominant
was the terrible saw-grass. Its stiff uprightness,
and its rasping, cutting edges would
make of it, Nicky decided, a formidable barrier
for anyone who tried to go through it.</p>
<p>Brownie agreed with his voiced idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went with another lieutenant across the
&rsquo;Glades, back a couple of winters ago,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It took us months. It&rsquo;s not so many miles,
but, as you can easily see, the grass grows in
big clumps, and it is so high that you can&rsquo;t spy
ahead and find the channels. There are channels,
but they are a good deal like the ones you
tell about in those Ten Thousand Islands. Some
of them run into blind ends and shoal up;
others are blocked by the saw grass&mdash;and if
anybody wants the job of trying to hack a way
through some of these clumps of saw grass,
they aren&rsquo;t named Brownie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Nicky, and Mr. Neale, could readily see how
difficult it would be to cut a way through: the
edges of the blades could inflict such deep
gashes in the hands that only by the most careful
work could one cut at them, and then only
in heavy gloves which would, in a short time,
be cut through. Even boots, Brownie said, were
not thick enough to withstand much work in
passing through the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In places,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we had to wade and
push our canoes&mdash;we had two specially built
canoes, and we made a survey while we crossed.
The grass tears at leather and rubber boots
and in almost no time it gets through. Look
across! See, about half way, there is a long
clump of grass&mdash;almost like land! Well, it&rsquo;s
just grass, and it is so long and so thick that
it took us a couple of weeks, going South, to get
down around it. In covering five miles straight
across we made more than forty miles of travel.
You see, we&rsquo;d go fifty feet and run into a dead
end, or into a bend that took us to grass; then
we&rsquo;d have to go back and search out another
way. Back and forth, around and back, through
and back, we went. I tell you, it was no lark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were rested, and with water enough to
float their dory, they turned her prow toward
the distant line of trees which marked the Big
Cypress Swamp and sculled carefully, winding
along the comparatively open way at the edge
of the rim of the &rsquo;Glades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>The Everglades are really a sort of inland
sea, very shallow and thickly studded with
clumps of the terrible, high grass. Around the
table land of the shallow sea, which rises gradually
toward its center line, something like a low
crest of a long underwater hill, there is a rim
of somewhat higher rock which keeps the water
in.</p>
<p>The water seems to be replenished by
streams or springs coming up through fissures
in the rock; its drainage is to the open sea and
the bays inside the outer reefs, through rivers
like the Shark and the Harney on the West
side, and the Miami on the Eastern slope.</p>
<p>Sculling carefully, and keeping a sharp lookout,
the trio in the light-draught dory progressed
steadily as the sun rose higher. It
was still very early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if the hi-jackers are awake yet,&rdquo;
said Brownie. &ldquo;They probably feel that they
are well hid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&mdash;ahead?&rdquo; queried Nicky, standing,
carefully balanced, in the stern. He sat
down and helped Mr. Neale to steady their
craft while Brownie rose at the bow and spied
over the grass at one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swan!&rdquo; exclaimed Brownie under his
breath, turning to his companions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;a
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>He turned and stared, under his cupped
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make out&mdash;why! It&rsquo;s the <i>Senorita</i>,
printed on the bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Senorita</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky softly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the tender we had taken away by Mr.
Coleson and Don Ortiga&rsquo;s brother&mdash;the one
they called Senor Ortiga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must have rowed in at the Harney
yesterday, and come around behind the
Shark,&rdquo; stated Mr. Neale. &ldquo;I wonder what
they intended to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not worrying about what they intended,&rdquo;
Brownie answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious
about what they&rsquo;re doing now&mdash;what has happened
to them. We ought to know. It might
upset our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody in the boat, or in sight,&rdquo;
Nicky whispered as they very slowly worked
the dory closer. The empty tender lay with its
nose to the rock and heavy fringe of underbrush,
grass and small trees at the &rsquo;Glades&rsquo;
rim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what!&rdquo; Brownie said, when they
were quite dose. &ldquo;That boat is moored to a
root on the rim-line. It&rsquo;s about opposite an
old Indian trail, too. A trail leads down beside
the Shark. You can&rsquo;t hardly make out the
mouth where the water escapes from the
&rsquo;Glades, the trees and brush is so thick. But
it&rsquo;s there, and the Indians have a sort of portage,
about opposite where the tender lays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to do some scouting,&rdquo; suggested
Nicky. &ldquo;Let me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Neale objected. Brownie, also, said that
he had better do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too stout,&rdquo; Nicky urged, &ldquo;and Mr.
Neale is not a woodsman. I&rsquo;ve spent two summers
in the woods, one up in Maine and one
out in the Sierras. I can go quietly and come
back without letting anyone know I&rsquo;m around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pleaded so eagerly and the danger seemed
so slight, if he kept his head, as he promised to
do, that they finally agreed, and he was allowed
to land on the damp, matted growth at the nose
of the dory as she swung close to the tender.
Nicky listened carefully to instructions from
Brownie and warning from Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be especially watchful about snakes,&rdquo;
Brownie said. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t so many in the
&rsquo;Glades, but in the heavy growth there are
plenty. But if you keep your eyes open&mdash;and
here!&mdash;take this pistol, in case of need!&mdash;you
can generally avoid them. If you fire three
times, quickly, we will come to help you. If
you fire at a snake, we&rsquo;ll come, too, of course,
but the three shots is to show that it is help
you need, of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The trail was almost blind, being little used,
and Nicky was hard put to it to discover his
way sometimes; but Brownie had told him
where to look for Indian signs on the trees and
lower tangle, and what sort of ground to avoid,
and he made a fairly quiet and very slow
progress.</p>
<p>Almost so suddenly as to be a total surprise,
he came to the end of the trail. Thick brush
and heavy tangle of every sort of vine and
creeper was just ahead; but through it his
quick eyes discerned the glint of sun on rippled
water, and the white reflection of a boat&rsquo;s bow!</p>
<p>There, moored close to shore, so that one
could step from it to the heavy roots at the
edge, lay the <i>Libertad</i>!</p>
<p>Nicky stayed where he was and looked and
strained his ears. He moved cautiously to one
side and got a better view. He could see the
forward deck, and there crouched the two
Ortiga brothers, the one they called the Senor
and the other, the Don.</p>
<p>Their voices were low, but they came clearly
to Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call a truce,&rdquo; Senor Ortiga was saying.
&ldquo;You and I have fought and won, back and
forth, times without number. Now there is
enough gold in this boat to make us rich&mdash;and
more back in the islands. Let&rsquo;s bury the
hatchet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is buried, amigo,&rdquo; his brother agreed.
&ldquo;Now I suggest that we also bury the treasure,
out in the &rsquo;Glades, and disappear for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would do but for one thing. We can&rsquo;t
trust our men. If they know where it is buried
they will come back and steal it&mdash;or you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; snarled the other suddenly angry
again. &ldquo;Or I&mdash;or you! Bury the hatchet! Oh,
yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our original plan&mdash;your plan&mdash;is best, after
all,&rdquo; said the other brother. &ldquo;We will wait until
the Seminoles come and pack the treasure
in cases when it is divided&mdash;then it will be &lsquo;each
man for himself!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go back to the rimrock and see if there
is any sign of the Indians,&rdquo; said Senor Ortiga,
rising. Nicky looked about quickly. He must
get back and warn his companions so they
could, all three, hide before the Senor arrived.</p>
<p>And as Nicky turned, his blood turned to ice
in his veins.</p>
<p>Lying along a low bough, not ten feet from
the ground, with its steady, unblinking, bright,
beady eyes fixed on him, lay a moccasin, a large
specimen of the &rsquo;Glades snake family!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Instinctively, and with the impulsiveness that
characterized his movement at many close corners
in life, Nicky lifted the pistol and fired!</p>
<p>As his finger pressed the trigger he realized
that, in the old adage, &ldquo;the fat was in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had upset all their careful plans!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">IN THE ENEMY&rsquo;S HANDS</span></span></h2>
<p>It was not the bullet from Nicky&rsquo;s pistol that
did damage&mdash;it missed the moccasin by a good
foot; but the sound, pounding through the still
morning air, warned and wakened the hi-jackers.</p>
<p>Nicky did not dare risk a run past the snake
which, in spite of the pistol shot, had not moved,
except to lift its head angrily.</p>
<p>From the position by the boats Mr. Neale
and Brownie heard the reverberating thud of
the exploding powder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in trouble,&rdquo; said
Mr. Neale. &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t calling for help!&rdquo;
answered Brownie. They listened, but no
further sound came. &ldquo;Guess he got it,&rdquo; said
Brownie.</p>
<p>But then their ears were assailed by a triple
succession of sharp explosions. This time it
was the summons, without chance of mistake!</p>
<p>Breaking through the tangle, heedless of cuts
and scratches, the sailor and the young collector
of relics fought their way along the faint
trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Nicky had aimed the pistol at the snake, even
as he pressed the trigger in the call for aid;
but his hand shook so that he made no effect
on the reptile which, alarmed by the sound,
slipped in a long, sinuous curve to the trunk
of the tree. Nicky drew a long breath. But
at the same instant that he heard the crash of
bodies in the trail, he heard, behind him, feet
thudding up from the waterside.</p>
<p>Turning, he lifted the pistol desperately in
the faces of the two Ortiga brothers; but they
were too close. As one knocked the weapon
high in the air it exploded its fifth cartridge.</p>
<p>At the sound the men on the path beyond
sight of Nicky gave a hail; at the same instant
stout, powerful arms closed around Nicky, his
opened lips were rudely smothered in a coarse
hand and he felt himself, struggling, kicking,
trying to bite, propelled toward the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fling him in and let&rsquo;s get away!&rdquo; cried Don
Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; panted his brother, with a wicked word
as Nicky teeth closed on his flesh and he
snatched his hand free. &ldquo;Make him a hostage!
Hold him. Here&mdash;ahoy, the ship! Give a hand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Nicky tore and fought but against two powerful
men. His fourteen years, his athletic prowess,
were little help to him. His strength was
in no way equal to theirs. From the <i>Libertad</i>
came excited voices.</p>
<p>From the trail broke cries and the sound of
Brownie&rsquo;s automatic barking as he caught sight
of the men; but Mr. Neale stayed his hand,
catching a view of Nicky in the group.</p>
<p>Before they could get there and intervene,
Nicky had been flung to willing hands, had been
thrust back into the cabin, an engineer was rocking
the flywheel of <i>El Libertad</i>, her motor took
hold with a roar and a tremble of the hull, Don
Ortiga and his brother had thrown themselves
onto the bow deck, clinging to the rail, and
then scrambling down out of range, and, backing
down stream, <i>El Libertad</i> was beyond the
leap of Brownie which fell short and sent him
plunging down onto the coral bottom.</p>
<p>Mr. Neale shouted to Nicky; he was helpless,
having no weapon. Nicky could not answer;
he was surrounded, his mouth was being
tied securely with a handkerchief rudely thrust
between his lips.</p>
<p><i>El Libertad</i> backed slowly but surely down
the stream.</p>
<p>From the bank Brownie, sputtering and
soaked, hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Libertad</i>&mdash;ahoy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Stop or we&rsquo;ll
sink you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;With what&mdash;your fat?&rdquo; cried a lusty sailor
with a roar of laughter. &ldquo;If you shoot you&rsquo;ll hit
your boy&mdash;see, here he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screening behind Nicky, whose bound form
they lifted into view, the evil sailors sent a defiant
guffaw back to the men on the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the rockets!&rdquo; panted Mr. Neale, tearing
back along the trail, &ldquo;the cutter won&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s happened. Send up rockets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brownie dashed back with him, and while
Mr. Neale was fumbling to set the rockets, and
dropping a packet of matches into the water
in his helpless eagerness, Brownie was tugging
at the light dory with all his strength, trying
to shove it over the rimrock into the shoals at
the head of the Shark; his idea was to row
down after the vessel and so to be on hand if
any help could be rendered. Mr. Neale had to
ask for matches; but finally the fuses hissed
and rockets roared up from the heavy roots into
which their sticks had been thrust, to break into
puffs of white, heavy smoke&mdash;the warning of
attack!</p>
<p>On the <i>Libertad</i> a hasty conference was held.
Nicky was not invited to attend the conferees,
but was bound quickly and thrown unceremoniously
into a corner of the cabin floor, to await
their further need for his protecting body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Whispers, gruff laughs, sharp negatives to
suggested action, were all that Nicky could
catch. Finally, however, he heard Don Ortiga
order the engineer to put on full speed astern,
and back went the white boat down the Shark,
a man at her stem to call the channel to the
tillerman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use him as a blind, say he&rsquo;s been hurt
and we want to deliver him up,&rdquo; Nicky overheard
a man confide to the engineer who was
necessarily absent from the conference. &ldquo;That
will hold their fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose fire?&rdquo; asked the engineer, wiping
gasoline from the lower edge of the carbureter,
which seemed to be leaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cutter must be laying outside,&rdquo; the
sailor declared. &ldquo;One man on the shore was in
uniform. They must have tried to surround
us. Lucky for us, the lad fell into our hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the engineer coarsely laughing.
&ldquo;If they offer to hurt us we can shoot him&mdash;or
whatever we like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the head of the Shark River Mr. Neale
was helping with the dory; its keel grated and
rubbed, offering resistance. They lifted and
bumped it along until it seemed safe to leap
in; but the added weight plumped it down onto
the coral again and they had to tumble out
and push once more. Then Mr. Neale leaped
in, Brownie gave a shove and fell onto the
stern on his chest, and clambered aboard. They
caught the oars and gave way with insane eagerness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>On the <i>Libertad</i> Nicky lay in his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go&mdash;if they don&rsquo;t&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of tight corner,&rdquo; Nicky said to himself,
and with all the cunning at his command
he kept his face impassive to the chance sight
of a passing sailor while, under him, cramped
as they were, he tugged fiercely at the hurriedly
made knots, his jaws aching from the wedge
of soiled linen crushed between his teeth, his
body bent toward one end&mdash;liberation!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">TWO IN THE TOILS</span></span></h2>
<p>Early in the morning Tom, on board the
cutter with Mr. Sommerlee, his engineer and
two of the patrol, decided that a brisk bit of
exercise would be just about the finest appetizer
he could desire.</p>
<p>There had been no signs at all of any excitement,
although Tom had taken his turn with
the others at watch while the cutter lay anchored
a stone&rsquo;s throw beyond the mouth of the
Shark River.</p>
<p>While Lieutenant Sommerlee got the dry-alcohol
stove lit up for their hot cocoa and fried
eggs, Tom saw no harm in a brisk swim to the
mouth of the river and back. Accordingly,
while the sun was giving Nicky his first view of
the &rsquo;Glades, Tom lowered himself from the cutter&rsquo;s
stern, not caring to risk a dive in the
poor light, and struck out gaily for shore, wondering,
as he swam, how Nicky&rsquo;s party was getting
along, back there beyond the heavy growth
that fringed the inner channels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Crawling out on a root, Tom slapped the
early morning chill of the water out of his
body, and rested before returning to the cutter.</p>
<p>He wondered, as he lolled on the roots,
whether <i>El Libertad</i> was actually hiding in the
river or not. He half wished that he had asked
Mr. Sommerlee for permission to swim up the
river a ways; it might help them to discover
the truth; they had no small boat and would
not wish to risk having the cutter discovered
before the landing party had its position and
gave a signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll swim up the river a few strokes,&rdquo;
Tom decided. &ldquo;Nicky swam a ways in Crocodile
Creek and we discovered the liquor stores;
it won&rsquo;t hurt me to do a hundred yards and
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly he slipped down into the limpid
stream, and against a slight current that did
not tire him at all, he pulled his lithe, muscular
young body along steadily. But when he lifted
his head to glance ahead he saw nothing; nothing,
that is, but water and low-clustered tree
roots on the banks, tall grass, and leaves meeting
in a heavy tangle along the banks and, far
beyond him, meeting overhead. The <i>Libertad</i>
was too close in, behind a tangle of weed and
grass, to be visible from his low point of vantage
in the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Suddenly his ears were assailed by a distant
thud&mdash;like a shot!</p>
<p>Tom listened. There was the deep silence of
the morning over all of Nature. &ldquo;Perhaps an
Indian is out hunting&mdash;or a white man has just
shot his breakfast,&rdquo; Tom mused, and deciding
that he had gone far enough he swung lazily,
and then set off with brisk strokes.</p>
<p>Then he beached and stood up on a ledge of
sandy coral reef. The three signal shots bore
their triple crash through the woods, followed
by Nicky&rsquo;s final shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds more like fighting than hunting,&rdquo;
mused Tom. &ldquo;I wonder if our land party
has made contact! I guess I had better go back
to the cutter and see if they have noticed any
rocket signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and began to swim back.</p>
<p>He had gone further than he had intended
to, however, and he felt pretty well tired out
by the time he came back to the river mouth;
so, deciding to rest and to hail the cutter and
ask for information, he drew himself up on
the root.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>He saw a flurry of activity on the cutter;
quite clearly he had been totally forgotten in
some new excitement. The motor was running
and Lieutenant Sommerlee, eyes fixed on the
far reaches of the river was maneuvering, backing
and turning to bring the cutter broadside
to the channel. Tom turned to look back up
the stream he had recently swam in, and saw,
afar, the white spot that would soon become
<i>El Libertad</i>, backing out because she could not
turn in the channel.</p>
<p>Mentally, Tom summed up the situation
quickly; if he tried to swim out to the cutter
he would interfere with the lieutenant&rsquo;s plans,
and perhaps be in the line of fire if the white
vessel continued to approach. He would surely
be in line of fire from her stern if he tried to
swim to the cutter.</p>
<p>Yet, naked and white against the dark foliage,
he would be just as much of a target, and
quite as noticeable, on his root.</p>
<p>Hastily, but warily, remembering saw-tooth
grass and snakes as very real menaces to unshod
feet and an unprotected body, Tom melted
into a thicket of heavy creeper and leaves, and
with his eyes peering through his green lattice,
he saw the white boat crawl out into view.</p>
<p>Then he saw something more. Nicky, still
gagged and bound, was up on the after deck,
held there by the arm of a man who cleverly
kept as much of his person below the coaming
of the after cockpit as he could.</p>
<p>Tom compressed his lips to hold back his first
impulse to call out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>How had Nicky gotten into that predicament?
What was he doing in the hands of the
enemy? He was prompted to shout to Nicky;
then sober second thought told him that this
might endanger Nicky, and it would certainly
draw attention to himself, not very desirable to
a white-skinned boy, minus his clothes, and
menaced by a pack of men evil enough to treat
his chum so rudely.</p>
<p>Tom held his position and watched.</p>
<p>Evidently it was the intention of the hi-jackers
to have Nicky discovered and recognized
by the crew of the cutter. Such was, in
fact, their aim. Mr. Coleson, compelled to expose
a portion of his arms in order to keep
Nicky in view, did not like his place nor the
rough treatment the boy had received. While
he had, it is true, helped to tie the boys on a
previous occasion, and had then deserted them
in their tender, and, later, with Senor Ortiga,
had stolen the tender in order to chase the hi-jackers,
he had not in any of this actually intended
any violence toward his youthful captives
or&mdash;as they later became&mdash;rescuers!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>It irked him, and went against his sense of
decency, weak though that was, to have Don
Ortiga cold-bloodedly crouch beside the engine
with a pistol in his hand, holding it trained on
Nicky, and, as Mr. Coleson made no doubt,
ready to fire with deadly aim.</p>
<p>Tom, on the shore, took in Nicky&rsquo;s plight.
Being elevated above the water edge, he was
able to see downward beyond the coaming of
the cabin sides, and he observed Don Ortiga&rsquo;s
position and its menace.</p>
<p>Still he held his lips pressed together. A
warning would do no good; silence could do no
harm.</p>
<p>From the <i>Libertad</i> the hoarse hail of Senor
Ortiga came across the water. The <i>Libertad</i>
had lost way and drifted very slowly stern-first
out of the mouth of the river. Those in the
cutter caught the hail also, and the hand Lieutenant
Sommerlee had partly raised to call for
full speed across the oncoming stem, was suspended
in midair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gun trained on this boy,&rdquo; cried
the younger Ortiga. &ldquo;We have his life in our
hands. We mean to get free and if you stop
us or fire or try any tricks, the boy pays for
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position into which the <i>Libertad</i> had
drifted was stern-out, so that the cutter was on
her quarter, and to the side farthest from
Tom&rsquo;s hiding place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>In that position, totally unsuspicious of his
presence, no one on <i>El Libertad</i> was paying
attention to his side of the river mouth.</p>
<p>Two ideas, two courses of action, sprang into
Tom&rsquo;s mind. The first was this: he recalled
that when the trio had lain, tied hand and foot
on the floor of the <i>Libertad&rsquo;s</i> cabin, the drip-drip
of the gasoline from a leaky carbureter
gasket had become very noticeable.</p>
<p>He recalled that Mr. Coleson had mentioned
it to Senor Ortiga, that night when they had returned
from their fruitless hunt, and said he
must fix it. The idea Tom had was that if he
could manage to get on board, unobserved, and
loosen the carbureter or destroy it, the white
boat would be powerless to escape. But the
men were all congregated at the stern, all except
the steersman, up in the cubby where the wheel
was located, at the forward end of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>The second idea grew from the first: in the
bow was the main gasoline tank; a pipe line of
copper ran along, close under the edge of the
cabin flooring, and up forward there was a petcock
in the line, so that the flow of what Mr.
Coleson, in his English fashion, called &ldquo;petrol&rdquo;
could be cut off in case of a break in the line.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; decided Tom, &ldquo;if I could get aboard
and turn that cock without my action being discovered,
the engine would stop as soon as it
sucked the compression tank dry&mdash;about a
tenth of a mile. Then they&rsquo;d have to surrender
or be starved out, and we could signal for help,
and certainly pick them off. Maybe, with Cliff,
I could plan to get Nicky free first! I&rsquo;m going
to try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom made as little noise as he possibly could,
climbing out of his retreat; if he was discovered,
he must be shot!</p>
<p>But they were all busy listening to some plea
or argument from the lieutenant. Tom made
his dip into the water without apparently attracting
the least bit of notice.</p>
<p>He waded softly, as far as he could, then
with deft, quiet strokes, drew steadily, if
slowly, closer&mdash;closer&mdash;closer!</p>
<p>If only they all kept out of range below the
cockpit and cabin coaming! Evidently, in spite
of the danger to Nicky, none of the desperate
crew cared for a chance shot from the cutter.
They stayed low.</p>
<p>Tom reached the side of the almost inert
white hull; with only a slight drift taking her
gradually past the cutter, she was evidently
being permitted to lie still until the drift got
her out of the way of the cutter, or far enough
into open water so that she could be turned
and steered in a forward run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Tom, huddled close under the hull, holding
to the loop of the anchor rope which hung down,
listened. As he came on he noticed that the
cutter was edging up, and that Nicky had been
dragged off of the after deck. Tom believed
that he knew why. They had threatened to do
something to Nicky in order to stop the cutter
from edging up.</p>
<p>A shrill cry from the <i>Libertad</i>, right over
his head, made Tom almost let go of his rope;
then he realized that to him it did not sound
like Nicky&rsquo;s voice! They were frightening the
lieutenant with a falsified noise, the cry of a
falsetto voice among the crew.</p>
<p>He could not see, clinging under the hull,
but he guessed that the ruse had succeeded;
he guessed, also; that, if ever, now was his moment
to act.</p>
<p><i>El Libertad</i> had drifted at least a boat&rsquo;s-length
back from the river mouth; probably
most of her crew would be looking toward the
cutter which must, by the changed position, be
off her forward beam. Tom lifted his hand until
he could loosen it from the rope without letting
the cable slap the side, then dropped back
into the water, pulled alongside the hull toward
the stern, and there reached up and caught the
rail with one hand.</p>
<p>Would he be seen?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Slowly he drew the other hand to the rail.
Nothing happened. He suppled his muscles and
then with all their aid working in the slow,
upward pull, he drew his eyes level with the
deck.</p>
<p>They were all forward, intent on something&mdash;Nicky
or the cutter!</p>
<p>Tom pulled himself up higher, made an effort,
and by ill fortune, on the instant of success,
slipped on the wet rail, and plumped down
in a heap in the cockpit, aft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">ONE LAST HOPE!</span></span></h2>
<p>Nicky, held, as he was, between two pairs of
strong arms, with Mr. Coleson on one side of
him and Tew on the other, saw that Lieutenant
Sommerlee, with his two patrols in the cutter,
was &ldquo;in a fix.&rdquo; It was plainly to be seen that
the naval man did not dare to open fire, because
of the threat to Nicky; nor did he dare to approach.</p>
<p>The lieutenant had prolonged the parley,
making offers and trying, by threat, by pleading,
by persuasion, to induce the desperate crew
of <i>El Libertad</i> to see reason, to give themselves
up.</p>
<p>Nicky had somewhat loosened the rope
around his wrists, but he did not let this be
known because he knew that he could not make
his escape and he wanted to save his strength
for a surprise at a more advantageous time.</p>
<p>Tom, flopping his wet, naked body onto the
after deck and tumbling unceremoniously into
the cockpit, turned every man&rsquo;s attention in
that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;So help me!&rdquo; shouted Tew, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a mermaid&mdash;no,
a merman&mdash;what&rsquo;s come floppin&rsquo; aboard.&rdquo;
He released one of Nicky&rsquo;s arms and crawled
aft. Don Ortiga still kept Nicky covered with
his weapon, a menacing glow in his eyes. All
of the crew crouched because they did not want
to risk the chance of an unexpected shot from
the cutter. Crawling to where the engineer was
rocking the flywheel, getting the engine to start
again, Tew confronted Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought you aboard?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to be with my chum!&rdquo; declared Tom.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll let me get Mr. Coleson&rsquo;s jumper out
of the engine locker, I&rsquo;ll thank you.&rdquo; Tew
nodded and Tom secured the jumper with which
to cover his body.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Sommerlee saw the naked body
land on <i>El Libertad</i> and realized that it was
Tom&rsquo;s, but did not see why the boy had deliberately
gone into danger.</p>
<p>However, as attention seemed to be distracted
from him he seized the opportunity to
make a sign to the man at the cutter&rsquo;s engine
and that sailor, with careful hand, advanced his
throttle, so that the engine got more gas and
picked up. The cutter began to nose in to
closer quarters with the white boat.</p>
<p>At the same time Senor Ortiga drew a
weapon and pointed it toward Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come forward,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Tew&mdash;or
somebody&mdash;tie him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you think I can do any harm,&rdquo;
said Tom quietly, &ldquo;but take that handkerchief
out of Nicky&rsquo;s mouth. What can he do by talking
that can hurt you? It&rsquo;s simply cruelty to gag
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out!&rdquo; snapped Don Ortiga. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t intend to be cruel, but you fellows are interfering
with us and we are going to use you
to cover our escape&mdash;then we will see what to
do with you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Tom, pretending to extend
his arms toward Tew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo; shouted Senor Ortiga to the
cutter.</p>
<p>But she had headway and was coming on.
Lieutenant Sommerlee had decided that he must
risk the possibility of harm to the boys&mdash;he
held that they would hesitate a long moment
before they would stain their hands with a
crime against life.</p>
<p>In that he was right, because the most hardened
criminals are really cowards and, unless
maddened or morally perverted, they will be
more afraid of death than of imprisonment, and
will weigh their chances of escape to the last
instant before actually committing a major
crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Nicky, seeing that his chance might have
come, suddenly wrenched his shoulder out of
the grip of the sailor, at the same instant giving
the sailor a thrust with his hands, and ripping
them free of the rope. The sailor staggered,
being off balance in his crouching position;
he cannoned against Don Ortiga.</p>
<p>Tom, fastening the strap of the jumper he
had donned, saw Nicky&rsquo;s move, and, being upright,
saw Lieutenant Sommerlee rise in the
cutter and take aim at one of the men.</p>
<p>With a catlike leap he sprang against Tew,
knocking him off his feet against the engineer;
the two men clutched one another for support.</p>
<p>Tom, his plan of action made sure, had seen
a wrench lying on the floor. For this he
reached; he got it in his hand and arose. He
turned toward the engine. The wrench rose
in the air and came down with all Tom&rsquo;s force,
sidewise, toward the carbureter.</p>
<p>But Tew had divined his purpose and with
a superhuman effort caught the swinging arm
and by his superior strength diverted the blow
enough so that it clanged harmlessly against
the water-cooling outer casing of the motor.</p>
<p>Tom, seeing the futility of his blow, released
the wrench.</p>
<p>As he sprang back there came a report from
the cutter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>But at the same instant Don Ortiga fired
back, crying &ldquo;Down&mdash;flat&mdash;everybody!&rdquo; They
all crouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump&mdash;Nicky!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Jump overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky leaped onto the cushioned side seat
and tried to elude the gripping hands. Tom,
on his end of the cabin floor, made a similar
effort. The engine roared as contact was made,
and the <i>Libertad</i>, gathering headway, swung
her nose and made straight for the cutter.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Sommerlee and his two men were
firing, but while woodwork in the cabin window
sashes flew in splinters, they had to fire carefully
so as not to touch the two boys.</p>
<p>Tom and Nicky were struggling, each caught
by the legs. They strove manfully against the
heavy odds, but while the men dared not show
their heads, or expose their bodies to the fire
from the cutter, they could drag at the boys in
safety.</p>
<p>The uneven struggle lasted only a moment
and the boys were lying, pinioned, panting, helpless
on the cabin floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>The <i>Libertad</i>, veering suddenly, made a
sweeping curve, turning aside from the cutter.
In the position which the cutter was faced, coming
head-on, she had to pass astern of the
<i>Libertad</i> before her men could control the tiller
and turn her rudder.</p>
<p>Nicky and Tom, lying on the floor, could not
see; but they heard the foul words of the
<i>Libertad&rsquo;s</i> crew and saw the flashes of their
weapons. Directed against the three in the cutter,
their superior fire was a menace that Lieutenant
Sommerlee could not overcome; before
he could, under the circumstances, get the cutter
around, <i>El Libertad</i> was racing, full speed,
for the channel that led outward. The cutter
came on, but the <i>Libertad</i> had the headway and
the advantage of her straight course while the
cutter had to swing in a wide circle before she
could take full advantage of her speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys will be sorry for what you tried,&rdquo;
grated Don Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry now,&rdquo; said Tom shortly. &ldquo;We
are sorry that we tried to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; panted Nicky, &ldquo;we ought to have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head toward Tom, his lips
shaped words, but only Tom, reading his lips,
got the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one hope,&rdquo; Nicky&rsquo;s lips formed,
&ldquo;Cliff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">CLIFF PLAYS HIS PART</span></span></h2>
<p>Cliff, on board the stranded <i>Senorita</i>, with
Sam and Jim and the naval patrol sailor, Jack,
knew nothing of the exciting events that had
just occurred.</p>
<p>Nor did he guess that an escaping white boat
full of desperate men was laying its course to
pass his station.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s effort to destroy the carbureter had
drawn the attention of the crew to the engineer&rsquo;s
repeated assertions that the leaky old
carbureter was wasting gas, and that they ought
to be sure they had enough to run the channel
and escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where can we get any more?&rdquo; said
Senor Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the wrecked <i>Senorita</i>, of course,&rdquo;
snapped his brother. &ldquo;Her tanks are almost
full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with the cutter coming, how can we stop
for gas?&rdquo; demanded Tew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; said a sailor, and revealed a plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>Of all that Cliff was ignorant. He, with Sam,
Jim and the sailor, had stood watch-and-watch
through the night and up into the day.</p>
<p>But nothing had altered the monotony.</p>
<p>But excitement was coming, and coming fast!</p>
<p>Nicky and Tom had been unceremoniously
roped and flung into the open cockpit aft of the
engine compartment. The cockpit was a low
step higher than the cabin flooring, but its
coaming and sides were so high that all the
two chums could see was the sky and, when
they ran close to an islet, the tops of the trees
where these grew near the water.</p>
<p>The cutter had been delayed for a moment
to pick up Mr. Neale and Brownie, who had
rowed with all their might and had sighted the
cutter in time to hail her and to be taken aboard.
Lieutenant Sommerlee wanted Brownie, a good
shot, and Mr. Neale would be able to play a
part if hand-to-hand fighting came about.</p>
<p>He sent Brownie forward and bade him scan
the water closely as they put full speed on to
chase the <i>Libertad</i>, long since passed out of
view beyond the first island of the archipelago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect they will try to do something to
delay us,&rdquo; the lieutenant said. &ldquo;They may drop
something in the channel, for there is one place
where it is very narrow and quite shallow, and
almost any large object&mdash;an anchor, sticking
up on the coral, would crush our bow planks at
the speed we&rsquo;re making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brownie kept a sharp watch, and soon discovered,
as they approached the narrowest and
shallower part of the channel, something dark
on the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliff and Jack and the colored men will
stop them I hope,&rdquo; said the commander as they
slowed and drew near to the submerged danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will, if they can do it,&rdquo; Brownie said.
He dropped over the bow and discovered that
his commander had foreseen exactly what had
been done; the <i>Libertad&rsquo;s</i> anchor had been cut
loose, and, with some spare engine parts, had
been flung from the white boat&rsquo;s stern into the
channel with the hope that the cutter would
run onto them and be entirely disabled, before
they were noticed.</p>
<p>While the damage was averted, it took time
to lift the heavy metal under the water, and to
displace it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cliff sat on the slanting deck of
the <i>Senorita</i>, with Jack and Sam, while Jim
hung close above them on the top of the cabin,
his eyes fixed on the distances of the channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do if they come in daylight?&rdquo;
Cliff looked up at him to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot at the waterline and let the water in,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll shoot back,&rdquo; objected Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the chance we have to take,&rdquo; Jack
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might load up the signal cannon with
some slugs, or something,&rdquo; suggested Jim. He
had begged Cliff&rsquo;s pardon for his part in the
tying-up and other maltreatment aboard the
<i>Senorita</i>; Jim was not a bad being at heart;
he had been employed by Senor Ortiga and Mr.
Coleson and had only done their bidding, with
no animosity or cruelty in his actions. Cliff
had readily forgiven him. Jim, thus made
happy, was just as determined to help the side
of right and justice as he had been, before, to
earn his pay honestly, as he saw honesty and
his duty to his employers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cannon wouldn&rsquo;t carry the slugs any
distance,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;d have to pass within three feet
of us,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>He pointed overside to the channel, where the
deep water was at the side of the wrecked vessel.
&ldquo;This boat ran onto coral because her tiller
rope broke, remember! There&rsquo;s plenty of
water, and they can pass us, but they&rsquo;ll have
to steer close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you fellows won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bossy,&rdquo; he
said, modestly, &ldquo;and if Jack won&rsquo;t be mad and
think I want to be the leader, I&rsquo;d like to say
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Always open to good
ideas, buddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff expounded a plan: his first idea was that
to fire at the vessel, if she ever came, would
bring about firing in response. If they could
in some way lure some of the hi-jackers onto
the <i>Senorita</i>, without their own numbers being
endangered, several of them might board
the other boat and destroy her steering gear,
or even capture her.</p>
<p>Jack liked the plan better than he did his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you can get them
to stop&mdash;if they come out at all, and if they get
past the cutter, which I don&rsquo;t see how they
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, they know, is on board,&rdquo; Cliff said.
&ldquo;My plan would be for Sam, and you, Jack,
and me, to hide behind the cabin where they
couldn&rsquo;t see us, and have Jim hail them, if they
come close enough and slow up enough to let
him jump aboard&mdash;and they might not. But if
they didn&rsquo;t, Jim could be up forward on the
cabin, and keep their attention on that end of
the boat, and when they come abreast maybe
one or more of us could run around the after
end of the cabin and jump aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty wild chance,&rdquo; commented Sam. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s better than risking our necks standing up
to be shot at&mdash;we&rsquo;d have at least the chance
of surprising them, and if we got aboard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a rocket!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;And another&mdash;&rdquo;
They all scrambled onto the cabin and
stared toward the distant coast. Three puffs
of smoke hung in the air, low over the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky&rsquo;s signal&mdash;or the cutter&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Cliff cried.
&ldquo;Be ready for&mdash;for anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wait was tedious. Their nerves were
taunt and their voices when they spoke briefly
were rather shrill and shaky. They did not
know what was happening or what might happen.
Would they be called on, really, to try to
stop a band of hi-jackers? It seemed very easy
when they discussed it in calm security; but
with those signals shredding into nothing in the
air, the reality and seriousness of their position
came home to them all.</p>
<p>The time seemed endless, but finally Jim,
alone on the cabin roof, whispered down, without
moving enough to disclose the fact to his
oncoming adversaries, &ldquo;here she comes&mdash;<i>El
Libertad</i>&mdash;and a-hummin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many on her? Who can you see?&rdquo;
asked Cliff, tensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>The white craft came ahead at her full speed.
After a brief wait Jim answered Cliff. &ldquo;I see
my old boss, Senor Ortiga,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
Marse Coleson! And some other men&mdash;why,
it&rsquo;s the men who used to be in business with
my boss, only they turned hi-jackers. Yes, sar,
there&rsquo;s Don Ortiga, the brother&mdash;and Tew&mdash;and
all o&rsquo; them, the very ones we sent you to
with that message in the can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Cliff. &ldquo;Never mind, now&mdash;hail
them, aren&rsquo;t they near enough?&rdquo; Being
under the cabin wall for concealment he was
not able to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they are,&rdquo; said Jim softly and sent a
hail across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me off, stop and take me off&mdash;Master
Coleson, it&rsquo;s Jim!&rdquo; he shouted. There was no
answer. The white boat, as he reported in low
tones, between hails, was slowing up, and coming
closer, losing way&mdash;stopping. Jim, to carry
out his part, sprang down from the cabin.</p>
<p>Cliff, Sam and Jack crouched; they were no
longer able to tell what was happening, but
they knew that Jim would call out &ldquo;Bless you
for saving me!&rdquo; if he got aboard and then they
could act quickly, knowing that the boat would
be opposite their end of the cabin.</p>
<p>Instead, another voice came, loud and clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about taking you off; we&rsquo;re stopping!
We need gas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get gas?&rdquo; asked Jim, from the
deck rail. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got no way to pump it
from one tank to the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we have,&rdquo; called the voice. Cliff thought
it sounded like Tew. &ldquo;We got a hose rigged to
our bilge pump, and we&rsquo;ll pump with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white boat scraped along the <i>Senorita&rsquo;s</i>
tilted side, and men swarmed over onto her
deck; the crouching three heard their boots
scrabble, thud and clump about. They were forward,
and Jim had run along the forward end
of the craft to continue his talk. The after end
of the <i>Senorita</i> was, therefore, beyond the after
rail of the shorter boat.</p>
<p>Cliff inched his way around the aft side of
the cabin until he could peer forward, taking
a big chance, but feeling that he must see.</p>
<p>Jack, and Sam, creeping close behind him,
waited in suspense.</p>
<p>Cliff took a swift peep and ducked back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re stretching a hose to the <i>Senorita&rsquo;s</i>
forward tank,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;There are some
men on the <i>Senorita</i>, and&mdash;let me look again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He protruded his head again, and then he
thought he heard a low whistle.</p>
<p>Cliff turned, looking down toward the stern
of the white vessel.</p>
<p>There, trussed up like two turkeys, in the
cockpit of the <i>Libertad</i>, lay Tom and Nicky, the
latter grinning a little sheepishly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>Cliff turned to his companions. His voice
came in swift, whispered words. Jack nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; he answered, hoarsely. &ldquo;Inch
as close as you can and we&rsquo;ll be behind you.
You take the cockpit, and free your chums. I&rsquo;ll
race forward, shooting, call Jim to help, and
try to prevent the others from getting off our
wreck. Sam, you shoot&mdash;in the air, in the water&mdash;anywhere;
but shoot, load again and shoot&mdash;holler
and try to scare them if you can&rsquo;t hit
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Sam. Cliff inched along the
deck. He was in plain view, now, from forward
on the <i>Senorita</i>, or from the <i>Libertad</i>.</p>
<p>But the trio in the cabin of the latter vessel
were deep in conversation, and the men were
busy with the hose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start your bilge pump!&rdquo; called a sailor. Tew,
on the white boat, bent and engaged a clutch;
there was a heavy grind of gearing and the
slow pulsation of a pump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; whispered Cliff, and dashed for the
rail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out&mdash;we&rsquo;re caught!&rdquo; yelled a man, on
guard atop the <i>Senorita&rsquo;s</i> cabin, watching for the
cutter. He fired at Cliff, but Sam, reaching
a black arm over the cabin studding, yanked
his leg, threw him off balance, and spoiled
aim. Shooting, yelling, Jack charged up
narrow deck, Sam at his heels.</p>
<p>Cliff leaped and landed beside Nicky!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">NICKY IS A HERO!</span></span></h2>
<p>Things happened so fast and so thick that
no one could have told a story of all that went
on. Cliff, landing on all fours, beside Nicky,
was up on his knees in an instant, tugging his
knife from his pocket, ripping open its blade.</p>
<p>He slashed at Nicky&rsquo;s rope, and loosened it;
again he slashed and then, at a warning cry
from Tom, he looked over his shoulder, but too
late.</p>
<p>Nicky, frantically tugging to loosen the cut
rope, saw Tew coming but was as helpless as
Tom.</p>
<p>Cliff dropped his knife and tried to get up,
to turn, to ward off the blow. Tew, his face
working in a rage, his whole, muscular frame
behind his stout arm, drove a fist at Cliff&rsquo;s
head. Cliff instinctively threw up his arm. The
fist crashed against it, flung him by its force
against the cockpit thwart, and Cliff felt sick
and faint, struggled to rise, saw the world turn
black, big and little pinwheels whirl before his
eyes, and sank in a heap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>Tew turned, and raced back to his engine.
Nicky, his whole being burning with a fire of
fury, tore at his rope and began to loosen it.</p>
<p>On the <i>Senorita</i>, the man atop her cabin was
firing at Sam and Jack but they, under the
shelter of the cabin, were crouched low, scampering
up the deck, loading their pistols.</p>
<p>The men forward with the hose, taken by surprise,
without their weapons in their hands,
scattered, several leaping into the water and
making for the islet close at hand.</p>
<p>Jim had already leaped into the forward
cabin of the <i>Libertad</i>, and with his pistol aimed
toward the deck of the vessel just above, was
warning off those who wanted to leap down.
They stopped, not daring to leap.</p>
<p>Nicky got his arms free, threw the rope impatiently
off and bent over Cliff. His chum
lay inert, stunned by the shock as his head had
struck the wood in his fall.</p>
<p>Nicky turned, to look for the knife, to free
Tom.</p>
<p>On the cabin top the man on watch gave over
firing and shouted a hoarse warning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cutter!&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full speed up the channel came Lieutenant
Sommerlee&rsquo;s craft, with Brownie, the lieutenant
and the two sailors forward, Mr. Neale at the
tiller, aft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>The men on the <i>Senorita</i> leaped to the water,
Jack and Sam coming from concealment,
standing erect, ordering them to surrender and
firing at their heads as they scrambled for the
islet and cover on the farther shore.</p>
<p>In the cabin of the <i>Libertad</i> the two men,
Mr. Coleson and Don Ortiga, called to Senor
Ortiga, who was on the deck of the <i>Senorita</i>,
and at the same time a rifle ball, from the man
on the cabin, aimed quickly at Jim, cut into
the flesh of the colored man&rsquo;s arm and he
dropped his weapon.</p>
<p>Without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, Senor Ortiga
leaped upon him, landed in the cabin, bent
double, knocking Jim aside, and began to reach
for the wheel, as Tew, leaping for the spark
lever, advanced the spark, and at the same time
threw the gear lever out of mesh with the bilge
pump and into the gear with the engine propeller
shaft.</p>
<p>As the engine took the spark and began to
roar, Mr. Coleson, his face white, leaped past
Tew to get to the cabin windows and thus to
jump out into the channel and take his chance
on swimming clear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Nicky made a lunge past Tew, to stop Mr.
Coleson, but his foot caught on the hose, still
connected loosely to the bilge pump, and tore
it free. There came the gurgle of the gas still
in it, as it flowed over the floor in a trickling,
spreading pool.</p>
<p>Nicky missed his catch, and saw Mr. Coleson
leap free and plunge overside into the channel.</p>
<p>From the cutter came hails and shots.</p>
<p>On the <i>Senorita</i> Sam and Jack had captured
one man, and were firing at the islet.</p>
<p>Nicky felt himself caught by the nape of the
neck as he tried to recover his balance. With
his face white with rage, Don Ortiga brought
Nicky upright and sent him, with the full force
of his strong arms, toward the forward cabin.
Then, as Nicky sprawled in a heap, Don Ortiga
turned on his brother, just arising to face him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your fault!&rdquo; he grated. &ldquo;If you
hadn&rsquo;t come in and left your boat to be discovered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; cried his brother. &ldquo;Where is the
gold&mdash;we must get it away&mdash;some of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is safe!&rdquo; growled Don Ortiga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go away from this spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go. You shall stay. Here and now
we settle an old score,&rdquo; cried Don Ortiga.
Nicky saw him unsheathe a knife, and at the
same instant Senor Ortiga, seeing his danger,
leaped to grip the arm holding the knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Nicky, rushing past Tew, who was steering
the craft, its momentum increasing with every
turn of the propeller, tried to trip Don Ortiga,
but the other man leaped aside, thrust at him
with a foot, and at that instant Senor Ortiga
caught the wrist of his hand holding the knife
and a battle ensued that made Nicky gasp.</p>
<p>Amid the shouts and the shots from the cutter,
amid the cries of men being caught or being
fired at in the water, with the craft making
steady way under Tew&rsquo;s guidance, those two
brothers strove and strained, fighting wordlessly
for the possession of that knife.</p>
<p>Nicky was held spellbound for an instant.</p>
<p>Then, with a cruel trick, Don Ortiga lifted
a knee and caught the brother he hated in a
vital spot and Senor Ortiga, with a groan, relaxed
his hold on the knife.</p>
<p>Don Ortiga stepped back, his face a mask of
hate and fury.</p>
<p>His brother began to recover, for the blow
had not been delivered with enough force to
be permanently damaging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, as I said, we settle old scores!&rdquo;
hissed Don Ortiga.</p>
<p>With a hand that shook he extracted a cigarette
from a case in his pocket, staring in meditation
on his evil plan while his brother, groaning
and white, gained his balance.</p>
<p>Don Ortiga scraped a match roughly against
its box, lit his cigarette and then, flicking his
match carelessly, loosed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>Nicky cried out shrilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gas!&rdquo; yelled Nicky. &ldquo;Get away! The
gas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senor Ortiga sensed the danger, and so did
his brother. Both acted; the Don leaped back
to the cockpit and began to scramble to its
side, his brother trying to crawl out of the
window.</p>
<p>It all happened in a fraction of a second&mdash;the
match was in the air, the men were escaping,
Nicky was leaping back toward Tew for
he saw what was coming.</p>
<p>Tew, as the match landed, yelled in terror
and began to climb from the cabin to the forward
deck and there leaped into the water.</p>
<p>As he did so there was a flash, a roar and a
seething, boiling pool of flaming gasoline
covered the cabin floor around the engine!</p>
<p>Nicky, whose first instinctive impulse had
been self-preservation, instantly thought of his
chums in the cockpit&mdash;of Tom, bound&mdash;of Cliff,
perhaps still insensible.</p>
<p>The men were being rounded up, by shouting
navy men and those who helped. But of this,
of the effort of Mr. Coleson to escape, of his
capture, of the capture of the Don and of his
brother, Nicky knew nothing.</p>
<p>His whole mind was fixed on one purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>He must get through a lake of seething flame
to his chums!</p>
<p>The cockpit was a bare few inches above the
floor level of the engine compartment, and so
the gasoline had not spread; but the flame was
licking the sides of the cabin, flaring through
the windows, and, fanned by the speed of the
vessel&rsquo;s movement, bellied out aft over the
boys.</p>
<p>Nicky was almost thrown off his feet as the
<i>Libertad</i> thrust her nose, unguided by human
hand, against the side of the coral, and with
a jolt stopped.</p>
<p>Nicky gained his equilibrium and leaped for
the foredeck; there he climbed swiftly atop the
low cabin and began to run along its length.</p>
<p>As he ran he shouted wildly to Lieutenant
Sommerlee and Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>They heard him and the cutter swung her
nose toward the beached vessel with its cabin
blazing.</p>
<p>Nicky saw flames leap up through the windows
and lick at the roof and blow over it in
the light breeze. It was hot to his feet, still
he went on, a handkerchief over his face,
crouching low as he ran.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>He stopped, at the after end, for a sheet of
flame was bellying out. But it subsided, and
taking what might be his last chance, he leaped
onto all-fours beside Tom.</p>
<p>Cliff was moaning, stirring. Nicky shouted
again to those in the cutter and Mr. Neale
leaned far over the bow, to reach the white
stern at the very first instant.</p>
<p>With seething flame behind him, threatening
to belch out over him at any instant, with the
cockpit edge beginning to burst into flame,
Nicky found Cliff&rsquo;s knife and sawed Tom&rsquo;s
bonds. Then, cutting down the ropes between
his legs so he could stand and work, Nicky let
Tom help his own final escape while he tugged
and worked to get Cliff in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; urged Nicky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam and Jack had seen the fire occur; with
a common impulse they had leaped into the
<i>Senorita&rsquo;s</i> cabin to get the patent fire extinguishers
always kept in an engine room. With
these they leaped back to the deck and alongside
the flaming cabin as Nicky crossed it.</p>
<p>Turning the extinguishers upside down to
break their containers and allow the chemicals
to fuse and mix and create pressure and a
spouting flow of watery gas, they turned the
short nozzles onto the cockpit and cabin. There
was the roar and hiss of chemicals meeting their
flaring enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>There came a great puff of smoke and flame,
but Nicky, just in time, on the edge of the
cockpit, with Cliff in his arms, leaped!</p>
<p>He struck the water, and began to swim,
holding Cliff&rsquo;s head up!</p>
<p>Tom, freeing himself at the same time,
sprang into the water and paddled to his chums.</p>
<p>The cutter came alongside and they were
drawn from the water.</p>
<p>And then, with a violent roar as the fire
found the gas line and fresh fuel, the fire blazed
up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tank&mdash;the aft tank!&rdquo; cried Jim, leaping
from the cabin floor where he had, with his hurt
arm, been trying to get the <i>Libertad&rsquo;s</i> extinguisher
into play. &ldquo;The tank! Get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped into the water and swam off, and
at the same time, with a glorious feeling that
some High Power had held back the end until
all were safely away, Nicky, in the cutter, saw
<i>El Libertad&rsquo;s</i> stern burst into a mass of fire,
sparks and rending wooden splinters.</p>
<p>Her stern, literally blown to bits, sank,
blazing and hissing, into the channel, leaving
her still blazing with her nose on the coral.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the treasure&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Cliff, who had
come to himself somewhat, with a good sized
bruise on his temple. &ldquo;It will all be melted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let it melt!&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;As long as you
and Tom are safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with no further word than a tight grip
of Cliff&rsquo;s hand, Nicky watched wordlessly the
blazing pyre of all their seeking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold won&rsquo;t burn,&rdquo; Lieutenant Sommerlee
consoled the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is more in the coral &lsquo;safe,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>They laid off all that day, watched the embers
sink down to the water&rsquo;s edge, saw the last
spark die, and then plumbed the wreckage for
the treasure, hoping that in a state of molten
yellow blocks it would be brought up. But no
golden bars were there, nor could a single glint
of melted metal be discovered, though Sam,
Jim and Brownie dived with a will and almost
tore the charred insides out of the <i>Libertad</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can it be?&rdquo; mused Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>They questioned their captives, but all were
silent. With a fierce grimace of hate Don Ortiga
told them they would never find it.</p>
<p>But Nicky held on firmly to hope!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><span class="small"><span class="small">HOW VOODOO BROUGHT SUCCESS</span></span></h2>
<p>Jamaica&rsquo;s Blue Mountains, looking with their
lordly heads over the wide expanse of a sunlit
sea, discerned a white sail. That was no
unusual sight to them; but this particular sail
seemed, in some way, to be more important than
the rest.</p>
<p>It was. Under its wide, unreefed expanse,
three youths, a colored and a white man
watched eagerly for the closer signs of the
island&rsquo;s harbor at Kingston.</p>
<p>In time they landed, and, after a while, they
had secured a conveyance and were whirling
out through the lazy streets, noticing with delight
the familiar sights, the indolent colored
people on the streets and in the shops, the
family &ldquo;flitting&rdquo; or moving, its colored woman
heading the procession with the dining room
table balanced on her head, its legs sticking
aloft, the family stuff piled within its upturned
top; while the children bore their respective
loads and the man of the family, as usual,
stalked along behind&mdash;carrying nothing!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see the cactus again!&rdquo; grinned
Nicky, noting the great plants by the wayside
when they left the city and rose into higher
ground, seeing cactus plants many feet high,
sometimes making a veritable forest with their
close-set ranks.</p>
<p>In time Mr. Gray, Cliff&rsquo;s father, greeted them
on the old plantation. They had cabled from
Florida before sailing back in Sam&rsquo;s <i>Treasure
Belle</i>.</p>
<p>Many were the greetings exchanged, and long
were the tales that had to be told. Nelse and
the hi-jackers were in prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Coleson was let go free,&rdquo; Nicky explained.
&ldquo;I guess the naval patrol did not want
to get into any trouble with the British&mdash;or
the authorities in Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have brought about complications,&rdquo;
said Mr. Neale. &ldquo;I understand that Mr. Coleson
won&rsquo;t return to Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cabled me,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray. &ldquo;He asked
me if I wanted to buy this plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; Cliff asked his father, the
scholar who wrote many books about ancient
civilizations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sar,&rdquo; broke in Sam, smiling his bright
smile. &ldquo;But Sam will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how you will spend your share
of the treasure?&rdquo; asked Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Part of it,&rdquo; agreed Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t yet told me how you discovered
it,&rdquo; Mr. Gray said. &ldquo;You stopped at
the point where you failed to bring it up from
the burned vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nicky, &ldquo;we &lsquo;worked&rsquo; a little
voodoo, sort of, didn&rsquo;t we, fellows?&rdquo; Tom and
Cliff nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, if the treasure wasn&rsquo;t in the burned
boat somebody must have hidden it,&rdquo; Cliff took
up the explanation. &ldquo;Nicky suggested that we
make an experiment. He thought that as long
as Don Ortiga declared, up and down, he knew
nothing about it, and Senor Ortiga and Mr.
Coleson said the same, it might be that somebody
else had hidden it during the night. Mr.
Coleson, who was sorry for what he had done,
tried to help us, and we believed his statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;So Nicky got Sam and
Jim, the colored boys, and made them tell all
they knew, or guessed, about voodoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was clever, sar,&rdquo; broke in Sam.
&ldquo;He found out that we had heard of people
&lsquo;divining&rsquo; from tricks, and that night we had
a voodoo affair on the after deck of the
<i>Senorita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cliff took up the tale, &ldquo;Nicky got
Lieutenant Sommerlee to get the sailors and
Tew together on the deck, then he and Sam
and Jim put on a regular show, making believe
they were going to find out who knew about it.
They had a smoky fire, and took bits of hair
off the heads of the sailors and burned them.
Tew acted as though he was afraid of it all&mdash;he
was superstitious. So he refused to give
us his hair and then Sam, here, pretended to
slip up behind him and snip some off with a
knife. And that made Tew nervous, but what
we really burned was some of the other sailors&rsquo;
hair&mdash;only Tew didn&rsquo;t know that. Then Sam
leaped up and pointed to Tew, and said: &lsquo;You
know, sar,&rsquo; and Tew broke down and showed
by his face that he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know where it was?&rdquo; demanded
Nicky, unable to repress himself any longer.
&ldquo;He had waited till they were all asleep, the
night before they were caught, and he had
dropped the bars, one at a time, into a pool
beside the boat. We found them there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lieutenant Sommerlee took us around
to Miami, and we stayed there several days,
unloaded the gold bars, had the bank assay and
value them, and deposited&mdash;oh, a heap for
everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course the hi-jackers were sent to
prison,&rdquo; Tom added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has anyone been found belonging to the
old Governor&rsquo;s family who should rightfully
share in our find?&rdquo; asked Mr. Neale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray. &ldquo;An old, widowed
lady, and she will be very glad of the money
for she is poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were glad for her, and unselfishly
voted to add a little from their plenty to help
the lady. Later she refused to take more than
a fair part, for that, she said, would keep her
in easy circumstances for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>While the boys were adding details of their
adventure and discussing what they might do
with some of the gold, and Mr. Neale and Mr.
Gray were comparing notes on the gold figures
and silver placques of a looted Inca city which
had been secured later from the treasure key,
a knock came at the door and Ma&rsquo;am Sib, the
old voodoo woman, came in with a goggle-eyed
boy of dark skin and about ten years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sen for Ma&rsquo;am Sib?&rdquo; she demanded in
her high, querulous tones. &ldquo;Did you, white
sirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; Nicky stated. &ldquo;We, the three
members of a secret order as powerful as any
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him sharply to see if he was
joking or trying to make her feel ridiculous.
Oddly enough, Nicky was really serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t be a lecture, Ma&rsquo;am Sib,&rdquo; Cliff
added. &ldquo;But we want to show you something
about voodoo that even you won&rsquo;t guess about.
If you can tell us how it&rsquo;s done, we&rsquo;ll be glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>Nicky, very serious, nodded to Tom who rose
and walked slowly over to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a roundabout way to do her a
favor,&rdquo; Mr. Neale whispered to the mystified
father Cliff was winking at. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was unostentatiously moving aside the
curtain on a small chest of shelves in which
various relics were stored.</p>
<p>Cliff came close to Ma&rsquo;am Sib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see anything like this before?&rdquo; he
asked. He laid on the table before the shriveled
old crone a small, rude figure, cut out of
stone, very much discolored, with its legs
broken off, and having a hideous face and arms
that stuck down without any hands to finish
them off.</p>
<p>The old woman stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;let me see! I know that&mdash;I
seem to remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughed Nicky. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strain your
memory, Ma&rsquo;am Sib. That is one of the ancient
Gods of an old Central American tribe. We
got hold of it&mdash;well, never mind,&rdquo; he did not
wish to say they had found it in the despatch
box with treasure, recovered later from the
locker of the burned <i>Libertad</i>, and that they
supposed the Spanish Inquisitors had taken it
from the Indians. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a powerful god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I seem to see&mdash;&rdquo; began the crone, rolling
her eyes toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you&rsquo;re not as old as this god,&rdquo; Cliff
told her. &ldquo;But it has strange powers and we
are going to show them to you.&rdquo; She shivered
and drew back but Nicky smiled gaily at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now you
stand it up in front of you&mdash;prop it against this
book! Now, make a circle in the air in front
of it, and then draw a circle around it with your
index finger on your left hand, and then say&mdash;&lsquo;Abacca-abbaca-brab!&rsquo;
three times and see
what happens&mdash;it won&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked at Sam. He was grinning,
but he nodded for her to do it. She hesitated
and then, taking some bits of queer stuff from
a bag she had, muttering some charm to protect
herself from evil, she made the circles and muttered
the words of Nicky&rsquo;s fol-de-rol.</p>
<p>There came a thump, and a small bar of gold
fell onto the table. Tom had flung it adroitly,
of course, but she fixed her eyes and stared as
if she would pop her eyes out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to know how it was done?&rdquo; demanded
Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you this gold if you tell me,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; began Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell&mdash;&rdquo; began Cliff. But suddenly all
three saw that Mr. Neale, whom they had long
before taught their secret signs, was making a
sign which they all interpreted to mean, &ldquo;Seeing
All, I see nothing; Knowing All, I know
nothing; Telling All, I tell nothing,&rdquo; the oath of
the Mystery Boys. Nicky grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Once you made three
clay figures of us and stuck their heads in the
sun; they brought us good luck so we brought
this god to give you some of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all she ever found out.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
